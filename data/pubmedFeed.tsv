The elimination of the covalent link following the His69Ala substitution was demonstrated to result in a significant decrease in activity, in the midpoint redox potential of the flavin, and in stability with respect to the wild-type enzyme, but does not modify the overall structure of the enzyme. We used CO as a model system to dissect the changes due to the elimination of the covalent link between the flavin and the protein (by comparing the wild-type and H69A CO holoproteins) with those due to the elimination of the cofactor (by comparing the holo- and apoprotein forms of H69A CO). The apoprotein of H69A CO lacks the characteristic tertiary structure of the holoprotein and displays larger hydrophobic surfaces; its urea-induced unfolding does not occur by a simple two-state mechanism and is largely nonreversible. Minor alterations in the flavin binding region are evident between the native and the refolded proteins, and are likely responsible for the low refolding yield observed. A model for the equilibrium unfolding of H69A CO that also takes into consideration the effects of cofactor binding and dissociation, and thus may be of general significance in terms of the relationships between cofactor uptake and folding in flavoproteins, is presented.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18218720 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Caldinelli L, Iametti S, Barbiroli A, Fessas D, Bonomi F, Piubelli L, Molla G, Pollegioni L</author>\n    <category>Protein Sci</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18218720</guid>\n</item>	10	1213831586

The cellular mechanism(s) through which these effects occur and the molecular target(s) of gamendazole action are currently unknown. Gamendazole was recently designed as a potent orally active anti-spermatogenic male contraceptive agent. We report here identification of binding targets and propose a testable mechanism of action for this anti-spermatogenic agent. HSP90AB1 (previously known as HSP90beta [heat shock 90 kDa protein 1, beta]) and EEF1A1 (previously known as eEF1A [eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1]) were identified as binding targets by biotinylated gamendazole (BT-GMZ) affinity purification from testis, Sertoli cells, and ID8 ovarian cancer cells, and confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS and western analysis. BT-GMZ bound to purified yeast HSP82 (homologue to mammalian HSP90AB1) and EEF1A1, but not TEF3 nor HBS1, and was competed by unlabeled gamendazole. However, gamendazole did not inhibit nucleotide binding by EEF1A1. Gamendazole binding to purified Saccharomyces cerevisiae HSP82 inhibited luciferase refolding, and was not competed by HSP90 drugs geldanamycin or novobiocin analogue, KU-1. Gamendazole elicited degradation of HSP90-dependent client proteins AKT1 and ERBB2 and had an antiproliferative effect in MCF-7 cells without inducing HSP90. These data suggested that gamendazole may represent a new class of selective HSP90AB1 and EEF1A1 inhibitors. Testis gene microarray analysis from gamendazole-treated rats showed a marked rapid increase in three interleukin 1 genes and Nfkbia (NF-kappaB inhibitor alpha) 4hrs after oral administration. A spike in IL1a transcription was confirmed by rt-PCR in primary Sertoli cells 60min after exposure to 100nM gamendazole, demonstrating Sertoli cells are a target. AKT1, NFKB, and interleukin 1 are known regulators of the Sertoli cell spermatid junctional complexes. A current model for gamendazole action posits this pathway links interaction with HSP90AB1 and EEF1A1 to the loss of spermatids and resulting infertility.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18218611 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Tash JS, Chakrasali R, Jakkaraj SR, Hughes J, Smith SK, Hornbaker K, Heckert LL, Ozturk SB, Hadden MK, Kinzy TG, Blagg BS, Georg GI</author>\n    <category>Biol Reprod</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18218611</guid>\n</item>	32	1213831580

TBADH subunits were 4.8 kcal/mol less stable towards guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) unfolding compared to urea, indicating ionic modulation of TBADH stability. Strongly denaturing conditions promoted mono-exponential unfolding kinetics with linear dependence on denaturant concentration. Here TBADH unfolded &gt;40-fold slower when extrapolated from urea as compared to GdmCl unfolding. A marked unfolding hysteresis was shown when comparing refolding and unfolding in urea. An unusual biphasic unfolding trajectory with an exceptionally slow phase at intermediate concentrations of GdmCl and urea was also observed. We advocate that TBADH forms two distinctly different tetrameric isoforms, and likely an ensemble of native states. This unusual supramolecular folding behavior has been shown responsible for formation of amyloidotic yeast prion strains and can have functional importance for TBADH.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18217202 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Mishra R, Olofsson L, Karlsson M, Carlsson U, Nicholls IA, HammarstrÃ¶m P</author>\n    <category>Cell Mol Life Sci</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18217202</guid>\n</item>	1	1213831573

Although the native structure of a protein is principally encoded in its amino-acid sequence, the process of folding in vivo very often requires the assistance of molecular chaperones. Chaperones also play a role in a post-translational quality control system and thus are required to maintain the proper conformation of proteins under changing environmental conditions. Many factors leading to unfolding and misfolding of proteins eventually result in protein aggregation. Stress imposed by high temperature was one of the first aggregation-inducing factors studied and remains one of the main models in this field. With massive protein aggregation occurring in response to heat exposure, the cell needs chaperones to control and counteract the aggregation process. Elimination of aggregates can be achieved by solubilization of aggregates and either refolding of the liberated polypeptides or their proteolysis. Here, we focus on the molecular mechanisms by which heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70), Hsp100 and small Hsp chaperones liberate and refold polypeptides trapped in protein aggregates.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18216875 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Liberek K, Lewandowska A, Zietkiewicz S</author>\n    <category>EMBO J</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18216875</guid>\n</item>	3	1213831569

In view of this realization, an alkaline protease from Bacillus sp. AH-6, displaying salt-dependent resistance against chemical denaturation by Urea and Guanidium hydrochloride was investigated for denaturation and in vitro protein folding. The crude enzyme was highly resistant against urea (8M) denaturation up to 72h; however, on purification, it turned sensitive and got denatured within 2h. Interestingly, the purified enzyme regained the resistance in the presence of NaCl. Effective refolding of the purified enzyme was achieved with glycerol; however, other approaches such as lower protein concentrations, rapid dilution and slow removal of the denaturant did not further add to refolding. The results are important from the viewpoint that only few enzymes from haloalkaliphilic bacteria are characterized. Since the resistance against chemical denaturation is a rare phenomenon, the findings would enrich the knowledge on protein stability and denaturation. Besides, such biocatalysts would definitely have novel applications under harsh chemical environments.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18215518 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Dodia MS, Bhimani HG, Rawal CM, Joshi RH, Singh SP</author>\n    <category>Bioresour Technol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18215518</guid>\n</item>	40	1213831567

In vivo, it is proteolytically processed post-translationally, so that the single-domain subunits of the initial homodimer themselves become heterodimers of intertwined fragment polypeptide chains. Despite this complex topology, mature pea seed lectin reassembles with considerable efficiency at low total protein concentration (10 mug/mL) and low temperature (10 degrees C), albeit very slowly (t1/2 approximately 2 days). Contrary to expectations, the primary assembly product is not the intact beta-sheet domain, but the larger fragment chains first dimerize to form the native-like subunit interface.

We present atomistic Parallel Tempering (Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics) simulations of conformational changes occurring during the photo-cycle of PYP. First, we study the signaling state formation of PYP in detail. Our previous simulations have shown that the formation of the signaling state is characterized by the solvent exposure of both the chromophore and Glu46 (Vreede J, Crielaard W, Hellingwerf KJ, Bolhuis PG. Biophys J, 2005;8:3525-3535). Subsequent NMR results agreed with this prediction, but as these experiments were performed on an N-terminally truncated mutant, a simulation of this mutant would further substantiate our previous results. Here, we compare simulations of the truncated PYP to the NMR structures, as well as to the wild type predictions. This comparison also gives some insight into the role of the N-terminal domain of PYP, which restricts the movement of the chromophore binding pocket (CBP) in the wild type. Second, we report simulations of the recovery of the receptor state from the signaling state. While we did not observe complete refolding of the protein, we did observe transient interactions between residues of the CBP occurring when the chromophore is in a trans configuration. Using simulations that sample anomalous exposure of the chromophore in the receptor state, we were able to sample chromophore re-entry into its binding pocket. While the involved time scales prohibit drawing definitive conclusions even when using parallel tempering, we nevertheless propose that the formation of a helix in the CBP is essential for a successful recovery of the receptor state, and forms a kinetic barrier in this process.

Physiological and molecular strategies have been implemented to revert or at least to control aggregation but they often meet only partial success and have to be optimized case by case. Recent studies have shown that proteins embedded in inclusion bodies may retain residual structure and biological function and question the former axiom that solubility and activity are necessarily coupled. This allows for a switch in the goals from obtaining soluble products to controlling the conformational quality of aggregated proteins. Central to this approach is the availability of analytical methods to monitor protein structure within inclusion bodies.

Ring-forming AAA+ (ATPase associated with various cellular activities) proteins play crucial roles in both processes by co-operating with either peptidases or chaperone systems. Peptidase-associated AAA+ proteins bind substrates and thread them through their axial channel into the attached proteolytic chambers for degradation. In contrast, the AAA+ protein ClpB evolved independently from an interacting peptidase and co-operates with a cognate Hsp70 (heat-shock protein 70) chaperone system to solubilize and refold aggregated proteins. The activity of this bi-chaperone system is crucial for the survival of bacteria, yeast and plants during severe stress conditions. Hsp70 acts at initial stages of the disaggregation process, enabling ClpB to extract single unfolded polypeptides from the aggregate via a threading activity. Although both classes of AAA+ proteins share a common threading activity, it is apparent that their divergent evolution translates into specific mechanisms, reflecting adaptations to their respective functions. The ClpB-specific M-domain (middle domain) represents such an extra feature that verifies ClpB as the central disaggregase in vivo. M-domains act as regulatory devices to control both ClpB ATPase activity and the Hsp70-dependent binding of aggregated proteins to the ClpB pore, thereby coupling the Hsp70 chaperone activity with the ClpB threading motor to ensure efficient protein disaggregation.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18208398 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Mogk A, Haslberger T, Tessarz P, Bukau B</author>\n    <category>Biochem Soc Trans</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18208398</guid>\n</item>	14	1213831554

These mechanisms can affect the stability of both the native state and the unfolded state. Previous equilibrium stability studies demonstrated that KCl stabilizes dihydrofolate reductases (DHFRs) from Escherichia coli (ecDHFR, E. coli DHFR) and Haloferax volcanii (hvDHFR1, H. volcanii DHFR encoded by the hdrA gene) with similar efficacies, despite adaptation to disparate physiological ionic strengths (0.2 M versus 2 M). Kinetic studies can provide insights on whether equilibrium effects reflect native state stabilization or unfolded state destabilization. Similar kinetic mechanisms describe the folding of urea-denatured ecDHFR and hvDHFR1: a 5-ms stopped-flow burst-phase species that folds to the native state through two sequential intermediates with relaxation times of 0.1-3 s and 25-100 s. The latter kinetic step is very similar to that observed for the refolding of hvDHFR1 from low ionic strength. The unfolding of hvDHFR1 at low ionic strength is relatively slow, suggesting kinetic stabilization as observed for some thermophilic enzymes. Increased KCl concentrations slow the urea-induced unfolding of ecDHFR and hvDHFR1, but much less than expected from equilibrium studies. Unfolding rates extrapolated to 0 M denaturant, k(unf)(H(2)O), are relatively independent of ionic strength, demonstrating that the KCl-induced stabilization of ecDHFR and hvDHFR1 results predominantly from destabilization of the unfolded state. This supports the hypothesis from previous equilibrium studies that haloadaptation harnesses the effects of elevated salt concentrations on the properties of the aqueous solvent to enhance protein stability.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18207162 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Gloss LM, Topping TB, Binder AK, Lohman JR</author>\n    <category>J Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18207162</guid>\n</item>	6	1213831552

The effect of the Cu2+ ions on PrP structure depends on whether they are added after refolding of the protein in water or are present during the refolding process. In the first case ROA reveals that the hydrated alpha-helix is lost, with UV CD revealing a drop from approximately 25% to approximately 18% in the total alpha-helix content. The lost alpha-helix could be that comprising residues 145-156, located within the region associated with scrapie PrP formation. In the second case, ROA reveals the protein's structure to be almost completely disordered/irregular, with UV CD revealing a drop in total alpha-helix content to approximately 5%. Hence, although Cu2+ binding takes place exclusively within the unfolded/disordered N-terminal region, it can profoundly affect the structure of the folded/alpha-helical C-terminal region. This is supported by the finding that refolding in the presence of Cu2+ of a mutant in which the first six histidines associated with copper binding to the N-terminal region are replaced by alanine has a similar alpha-helix content to the metal-free protein. In contrast, when the protein is refolded in the presence of divalent manganese ions, ROA indicates the alpha-helix is reinforced, with UV CD revealing an increase in total alpha-helix content to approximately 30%. The very different influence of Cu2+ and Mn2+ ions on prion protein structure may originate in the different stability constants and geometries of their complexes.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18205409 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Zhu F, Davies P, Thompsett AR, Kelly SM, Tranter GE, Hecht L, Isaacs NW, Brown DR, Barron LD</author>\n    <category>Biochemistry</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18205409</guid>\n</item>	9	1213831549

However, the human enzyme, unlike its insect counterparts, does not efficiently hydrolyze the platelet agonist, ADP. By site-directed mutagenesis, two mutant human SCANs were constructed and expressed in bacteria. Following refolding from inclusion bodies and purification, these enzymes were assessed for anti-coagulant and anti-thrombotic efficacy. These engineered proteins include both active site mutations and a dimer interface mutation to increase the stability and ADPase activity of the modified human nucleotidase. The ADPase activity of these mutants increased more than ten fold. The E130Y/K201M/E216M SCAN mutant efficiently inhibited platelet aggregation in vitro. In addition, the E130Y/K201M/T206K/T207E/E216M mutant inhibited jugular vein thrombosis in the murine ferric chloride-induced model of thrombosis, as assessed by laser Doppler blood flow measurements. The bed bug insect homologue of human SCAN was also expressed and purified, and used in these in vivo experiments as a benchmark to assess the therapeutic potential of the engineered human enzymes. The most active modified human enzyme was able to completely inhibit the thrombosis induced by ferric chloride at roughly double the protein dose used for the bed bug enzyme. Thus, for the first time, we show that an engineered form of this human protein is efficacious in an in vivo model of thrombosis, demonstrating that suitably modified human SCAN enzymes have therapeutic potential as anti-coagulant and anti-thrombotic therapeutic agents. This suggests their utility in future treatment strategies for thrombotic cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarctions and ischemic strokes.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18222531 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Yang M, Kirley TL</author>\n    <category>Thromb Res</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18222531</guid>\n</item>	42	1213831541

To elucidate structural factors involved in such nucleotide selectivity, chimeric GroELs were constructed by exchanging apical, intermediate and equatorial domains between EC GroEL and CP GroEL1. In vitro folding assays using chimeras revealed that the intermediate domain is the major contributor to the nucleotide selectivity of CP GroEL1.

From the linear Arrhenius plots of the microscopic folding and unfolding rate constants, activation enthalpy (DeltaH(#)), and activation entropy (DeltaS(#)) were determined to characterize the kinetic transition states (TS) for the unfolding and refolding reactions. The single TS of the wild-type protein was split into three for the Y115W variant. Two of them, TS1 and TS2, characterize a slow kinetic phase, and one, TS3, a fast phase. Heating T-jumps induced protein unfolding via TS2 and TS3; cooling T-jumps induced refolding via TS1 and TS3. The observed speed of the fast phase increased at lower temperature, due to a strongly negative DeltaH(#) of the folding rate constant. The results are consistent with a path-dependent protein folding/unfolding mechanism. TS1 and TS2 are likely to reflect X-Pro114 isomerization in the folded and unfolded protein, respectively, and TS3 the local conformational change of the beta-hairpin comprising Trp115.

The signaling cascades induced by G protein activation control a wide range of cellular processes. The alpha subunit is believed to determine which G protein couples to each GPCR, and is the primary determinant of the type of signal transmitted. Several members of the G(alpha) family have been expressed in active form in Escherichia coli. However, production levels of these proteins are limited: in most cases only approximately 10% of total G(alpha) protein expressed is active; the rest accumulates in inclusion bodies. Although G(ialpha) has been readily expressed in soluble form (to 10mg/L), other alpha subunits are minimally soluble, and many are exclusively expressed to inclusion bodies. Previous efforts to solubilize and refold G(alpha) from inclusion bodies have not been successful. Here we did a thorough study of the characteristics of G(alpha) subunits (human G(ialpha(1)), human G(salpha(short)), human G(11alpha) and human G(talpha(cone))), solubilized and purified from inclusion bodies. We find that we can obtain soluble protein both by on-column and rapid-dilution techniques. Comparison to native, soluble G(ialpha) expressed from E. coli showed that although the refolded G(alpha) subunits were soluble and retained partial alpha-helicity characteristic of the native, folded G(alpha) subunit, they did not bind GDP or GTP as effectively as native protein. We conclude that the refolded G(ialpha) protein has a native-like secondary structure, but is predominately in a molten globular state.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18249008 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> McCusker E, Robinson AS</author>\n    <category>Protein Expr Purif</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18249008</guid>\n</item>	45	1213831519

Therefore, individual isomers have the potential to differ in bioactivity. However, information about isomer-specific bioactivities is difficult to obtain because of the risk of affecting isomeric distribution by bioactivity assay components. Here we present an approach that allows for the measurement of the recovery of enzymatic activities of wild-type RNase T(1) and RNase T(1) variants during refolding under conditions where the population of enzyme-substrate or enzyme-product complexes is negligible. Recovery of enzymatic activity was continuously monitored within the visible range of the spectrum by addition of a fluorescence-labeled nucleotide substrate to the refolding sample. We found that a nonnative trans conformation at Pro39 renders the RNase T(1) almost completely inactive. A folding intermediate having a nonnative trans conformation at Pro55 shows about 46% of the enzymatic activity referred to the native state. Pro55, in contrast to the active site located Pro39, is situated in a solvent-exposed loop region remote from active-site residues. In both cases, peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerases accelerate the regain of nucleolytic activity. Our findings show that even if there is a considerable distance between the site of isomerization and the active site, conformational control of the bioactivity of proteins is likely to occur, and that the surface location of prolyl bonds suffices for the control of buried active sites mediated by peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerases.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18234226 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> AumÃ¼ller T, Fischer G</author>\n    <category>J Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18234226</guid>\n</item>	1	1213831527

Our idea is based on the exchange between different force replicas to accelerate the equilibrium process. This new approach was applied to obtain the force-temperature phase diagram and other thermodynamical quantities of the three-domain ubiquitin. Using the C(alpha)-Go model and the Langevin dynamics, we have shown that the refolding pathways of single ubiquitin depend on which terminus is fixed. If the N end is fixed then the folding pathways are different compared to the case when both termini are free, but fixing the C terminal does not change them. Surprisingly, we have found that the anchoring terminal does not affect the pathways of individual secondary structures of three-domain ubiquitin, indicating the important role of the multidomain construction. Therefore, force-clamp experiments, in which one end of a protein is kept fixed, can probe the refolding pathways of a single free-end ubiquitin if one uses either the polyubiquitin or a single domain with the C terminus anchored. However, it is shown that anchoring one end does not affect refolding pathways of the titin domain I27, and the force-clamp spectroscopy is always capable to predict folding sequencing of this protein. We have obtained the reasonable estimate for unfolding barrier of ubiquitin, using the microscopic theory for the dependence of unfolding time on the external force. The linkage between residue Lys48 and the C terminal of ubiquitin is found to have the dramatic effect on the location of the transition state along the end-to-end distance reaction coordinate, but the multidomain construction leaves the transition state almost unchanged. We have found that the maximum force in the force-extension profile from constant velocity force pulling simulations depends on temperature nonlinearly. However, for some narrow temperature interval this dependence becomes linear, as have been observed in recent experiments.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18248010 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Kouza M, Hu CK, Li MS</author>\n    <category>J Chem Phys</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18248010</guid>\n</item>	5	1213831516

Based on the structural information, the fluorescence quenching in high concentrations of KPB was ascribed to less rigid chromophores caused by the weakening of the hydrogen-bond interaction network, while the enhancement of the fluorescence and E(T) was due to the aggregation of the subunits in the ionic solvent. Aggregation was confirmed by cysteine-assisted promotion of renaturation yield and stability, as well as equilibrium unfolding tests. Optimal conditions were proposed for the refolding/unfolding studies, under which the subunits were mainly monomeric.

Due to its importance in cellular energetics, the activity and level of CK are crucial to cellular and body functions. CK is sensitive to oxidative stresses and is thought to be one of the main targets of oxidative modification in neurodegenerative diseases. In this research, we investigated the effect of copper, an essential trace element for all organisms and an inducer of the reactive oxygen species, on CK refolding. It was found that trace amounts of Cu(2+) (3mol eq of Cu(2+)) could efficiently block the refolding of CK. The Cu(2+)-trapped CK could not be reactivated by the addition of EDTA, but could be reactivated by DTT. Spectroscopic experiments suggested that copper ions blocked CK refolding by specifically binding with the monomeric refolding intermediate, which further retarded CK refolding and promoted the formation of off-pathway aggregates. The results herein suggested that Cu(2+)-induced CK dysfunction might be caused not only by the post-translational oxidation, but also by the direct binding of copper ions with the newly-synthesized polypeptides.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18255152 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Feng S, Xu Z, Yan YB</author>\n    <category>J Inorg Biochem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18255152</guid>\n</item>	27	1213831514

The contrasting properties of the two sub-domains clearly indicate that they make up two units of the rod domain that are not structurally interchangeable, thus providing molecular evidence supporting the observations on the biological function of dystrophin.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18261477 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Legardinier S, Hubert JF, Bihan OL, Tascon C, Rocher C, RaguÃ©nÃ¨s-Nicol C, Bondon A, Hardy S, Rumeur EL</author>\n    <category>Biochim Biophys Acta</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18261477</guid>\n</item>	5	1213831505

To obtain an estimate of the barrier height from the calorimetric data, two models, a variable-barrier model and an Ising-like model, were used to fit the heat capacity in excess of the folded state over the temperature range 15-125 degrees C. The variable-barrier model is based on an empirical mathematical form for the density of states, with four adjustable parameters and the enthalpy (H) as a reaction coordinate. The Ising-like model is based on the inter-residue contact map of the X-ray structure with exact enumeration of approximately 105 possible conformations, with two adjustable parameters in the partition function, and either the fraction of native contacts (Q) or the number of ordered residues (P) as reaction coordinates. The variable-barrier model provides an excellent fit to the data and yields a barrier height at the folding temperature ranging from 0.4 to 1.1 kcal mol-1, while the Ising-like model provides a less good fit and yields barrier heights of 2.3 +/- 0.1 kcal mol-1 and 2.1 +/- 0.1 kcal mol-1 for the Q and P reaction coordinates, respectively. In both models, the barrier to folding increases with increasing temperature. Assuming a sufficiently large activation energy for diffusion on the free-energy surfaces, both models are consistent with the observation of a temperature-independent folding rate in previously published laser temperature-jump experiments. Analysis of this kinetic data, using an approximate form for the pre-exponential factor of Kramers theory and the 70 ns relaxation time for the fast phase that precedes the unfolding/refolding relaxation to determine the diffusion coefficient, results in a barrier height of 1.6 +/- 0.3 kcal mol-1 for an unspecified reaction coordinate. Although no independent test of the validity of the H, Q, or P reaction coordinates is given, the barrier-height estimates obtained with the three reaction coordinates are in quite good agreement with the value derived from a Kramers analysis of the kinetics that makes no assumptions about the reaction coordinate. However, the higher estimates obtained using Q or P appear more consistent with the finding of barrier-crossing kinetics of a villin mutant that folds in 700 ns, corresponding to a 1.3 kcal mol-1 reduction in the folding barrier relative to wild-type.

This hypothetical protein contains a putative betagamma-crystallin-like domain, along with other domains for carbohydrate binding regions. It is named as Hahellin. A PCR amplified stretch of 92-amino acid residue long protein was cloned into pET21a vector and overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. The recombinant Hahellin, produced as inclusion bodies, was estimated to be around 50% of the total cellular protein content which was solubilized in 8M urea. The protein was purified and refolded using an anion exchange column. The MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry revealed the purity and monomeric nature of the protein. Further, a method to prepare isotopically ((15)N/(13)C) labeled protein with high yield for NMR studies is reported. The uniformly (15)N-labeled Hahellin thus produced has been characterized by recording a sensitivity enhanced 2D [(15)N]-[(1)H] HSQC spectrum.

This process requires the intracellular dissociation of the enzymatic CTA1 domain from the holotoxin components CTA2 and B5, followed by subsequent interaction with the host factor ADP ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6)-GTP. We report the first NMR-based solution structural data for the CT enzymatic domain (CTA1). We show that this free enzymatic domain partially unfolds at the C-terminus and binds its protein partners at both the beginning and the end of this activation process. Deviations from random coil chemical shifts (Deltadelta(coil)) indicate helix formation in the activation loop, which is essential to open the toxin's active site and occurs prior to its association with human protein ARF6. We performed NMR titrations of both free CTA1 and an active CTA1:ARF6-GTP complex with NAD(+), which revealed that the formation of the complex does not significantly enhance NAD(+) binding. Partial unfolding of CTA1 is further illustrated by using 4,4'-bis(1-anilinonaphthalene 8-sulfonate) fluorescence as an indicator of the exposed hydrophobic character of the free enzyme, which is substantially reduced when bound to ARF6-GTP. We propose that the primary role of ARF6's allostery is to induce refolding of the C-terminus of CTA1. Thus, as a folded globular toxin complex, CTA1 escapes the chaperone and proteasomal components of the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation pathway in the cytosol and then proceeds to ADP ribosylate its target G(s)alpha, triggering the downstream events associated with the pathophysiology of cholera.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18272180 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Ampapathi RS, Creath AL, Lou DI, Craft JW, Blanke SR, Legge GB</author>\n    <category>J Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18272180</guid>\n</item>	5	1213831498

In addition to the intrinsic interest in this area of research, structural studies of membrane proteins have direct significance on the development of therapeutics that impact human health in diverse and important ways. In this article we demonstrate the potential of investigating the structure of membrane proteins using the reverse micelle forming surfactant dioctyl sulfosuccinate (AOT) in application to the prototypical model ion channel gramicidin A. Reverse micelles are surfactant based nanoparticles which have been employed to investigate fundamental physical properties of biomolecules. The results of this solution NMR based study indicate that the AOT reverse micelle system is capable of refolding and stabilizing relatively high concentrations of the native conformation of gramicidin A. Importantly, pulsed-field-gradient NMR diffusion and NOESY experiments reveal stable gramicidin A homodimer interactions that bridge reverse micelle particles. The spectroscopic benefit of reverse micelle-membrane protein solubilization is also explored, and significant enhancement over commonly used micelle based mimetic systems is demonstrated. These results establish the effectiveness of reverse micelle based studies of membrane proteins, and illustrate that membrane proteins solubilized by reverse micelles are compatible with high resolution solution NMR techniques.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18297402 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Van Horn WD, Ogilvie ME, Flynn PF</author>\n    <category>J Biomol NMR</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18297402</guid>\n</item>	70	1213772637

Both are the prime targets of the humoral immune response. Recombinant variants of the E1 ectodomain as well as E1 antigen preparations from virus lysates are commonly used to detect anti-Rubella immunoglobulins in human sera. Hitherto, recombinant E1 for diagnostic applications has been produced chiefly in eukaryotic expression systems. Here, we report the high-yield overproduction of an engineered E1 ectodomain in the Escherichia coli cytosol and its simple and convenient renaturation into a highly soluble and immunoreactive conformation. C-Terminal fusion to one or two units of the E. coli chaperone SlyD enhances expression, facilitates in vitro refolding, and improves the overall solubility of Rubella E1. As part of this fusion protein, the E1 ectodomain fragment of residues 201-432 adopts an immunoreactive fold, providing a promising tool for the sensitive and specific detection of anti-E1 IgG in Rubella serology. Two disulfide bonds in the membrane-adjacent part of the E1 ectodomain are sufficient to generate conformations with a high and specific antigenicity. The covalently attached chaperone modules do not impair antibody recognition and binding of Rubella E1 when assessed in a heterogeneous immunoassay. SlyD and related folding helpers are apparently generic tools for the expression and refolding of otherwise unavailable proteins of diagnostic or medical importance.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18330994 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Scholz C, Thirault L, Schaarschmidt P, Zarnt T, Faatz E, Engel AM, Upmeier B, Bollhagen R, Eckert B, Schmid FX</author>\n    <category>Biochemistry</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18330994</guid>\n</item>	17	1213772632

The expression of these kinases in Escherichia coli often leads to the accumulation of the expressed protein as insoluble inclusion bodies. The refolding of these inclusion bodies could provide a route to soluble protein, but there is little reported success in this area. We set out to develop a system for the screening of refolding conditions for a model protein kinase, p38alpha, and applied this system to denatured p38alpha derived from natively folded and inclusion body protein. Clear differences were observed in the refolding yields obtained, suggesting differences in the folded state of these preparations.

In addition to the intrinsic interest in this area of research, structural studies of membrane proteins have direct significance on the development of therapeutics that impact human health in diverse and important ways. In this article we demonstrate the potential of investigating the structure of membrane proteins using the reverse micelle forming surfactant dioctyl sulfosuccinate (AOT) in application to the prototypical model ion channel gramicidin A. Reverse micelles are surfactant based nanoparticles which have been employed to investigate fundamental physical properties of biomolecules. The results of this solution NMR based study indicate that the AOT reverse micelle system is capable of refolding and stabilizing relatively high concentrations of the native conformation of gramicidin A. Importantly, pulsed-field-gradient NMR diffusion and NOESY experiments reveal stable gramicidin A homodimer interactions that bridge reverse micelle particles. The spectroscopic benefit of reverse micelle-membrane protein solubilization is also explored, and significant enhancement over commonly used micelle based mimetic systems is demonstrated. These results establish the effectiveness of reverse micelle based studies of membrane proteins, and illustrate that membrane proteins solubilized by reverse micelles are compatible with high resolution solution NMR techniques.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18297402 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Van Horn WD, Ogilvie ME, Flynn PF</author>\n    <category>J Biomol NMR</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18297402</guid>\n</item>	72	1213831488

The scaffolding protein of bacteriophage SPP1 was engineered with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag (gp11-His(6)) and purified. The protein is an alpha-helical-rich molecule with a very elongated shape as found for internal scaffolding proteins from other phages. It is a 3.3 S tetramer of 93.6 kDa at micromolar concentrations. Intersubunit cross-linking of these tetramers generated preferentially covalently bound dimers, revealing that gp11-His(6) is structurally a dimer of dimers. Incubation at temperatures above 37 degrees C correlated with a reduction of its alpha-helical content and a less effective intersubunit cross-linking. Complete loss of secondary structure was observed at temperatures above 60 degrees C. Refolding of gp11-His(6) thermally denatured at 65 degrees C led to reacquisition of the protein native ellipticity spectrum but the resulting population of molecules was heterogeneous. Its hydrodynamic behavior was compatible with a mix of 3.3 S elongated tetramers ( approximately 90%) and a smaller fraction of 2.4 S dimers ( approximately 10%). This population of gp11-His(6) was competent to direct polymerization of the SPP1 major capsid protein gp13 into procapsid-like structures in a newly developed assembly assay in vitro. Although native tetramers were active in assembly, refolded gp11-His(6) showed enhanced binding to gp13 revealing a more active species for interaction with the major capsid protein than native gp11-His(6).</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18377930 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Poh SL, El Khadali F, Berrier C, Lurz R, Melki R, Tavares P</author>\n    <category>J Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18377930</guid>\n</item>	0	1213772629

Here we investigated whether such states also exist under alkaline buffer conditions. The guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl)-induced unfolding transition and kinetic refolding of equine beta-lactoglobulin (ELG) by GuHCl-jump were investigated at pH 8.7 by far-ultraviolet circular dichroism. We found that an equilibrium intermediate appeared in 45% ethylene glycol (EGOH) buffer with 1.5 M GuHCl. The intermediate is rich in non-native alpha-helix, which is similar to the helix-rich state of ELG at pH 4.0. A kinetic study was done on the folding rate of ELG and compared with bovine beta-lactoglobulin (BLG). Transient intermediates, which were observed as the burst phase of the refolding reaction, were also rich in alpha-helix. The activation enthalpy of ELG was calculated to be c.a. 80 kJ/mol, whereas that of BLG was c.a. 70 kJ/mol in the presence of 45% EGOH. The ellipticities of the transient intermediate of ELG show temperature dependence in the presence of 45% EGOH, whereas that of BLG did not show significant dependence.

However, difficulties in producing membrane proteins have hampered investigations of structure and function. In vivo production systems are often limited by cell toxicity, and previous in vitro approaches have required unnatural folding pathways using detergents or lipid solutions. To overcome these limitations, we present an improved cell-free expression system which produces high yields of integral membrane proteins without the use of detergents or refolding steps. Our cell-free reaction activates an Escherichia coli-derived cell extract for transcription and translation. Purified E. coli inner membrane vesicles supply membrane-bound components and the lipid environment required for insertion and folding. Using this system, we demonstrate successful synthesis of two complex integral membrane transporters, the tetracycline pump (TetA) and mannitol permease (MtlA), in yields of 570+/-50 mug/mL and 130+/-30 mug/mL of vesicle-associated protein, respectively. These yields are up to 400 times typical in vivo concentrations. Insertion and folding of these proteins are verified by sucrose flotation, protease digestion, and activity assays. Whereas TetA incorporates efficiently into vesicle membranes with over two-thirds of the synthesized protein being inserted, MtlA yields appear to be limited by insufficient concentrations of a membrane-associated chaperone.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18295592 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Wuu JJ, Swartz JR</author>\n    <category>Biochim Biophys Acta</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18295592</guid>\n</item>	305	1213831481

For a diagnostic purpose, sufficient amounts of either natural Ani s 1 (nAni s 1) or recombinant Ani s 1 (rAni s 1) with an IgE-binding capacity should be stably supplied whenever needed. In this study, therefore, we first developed a simple and rapid purification method for Ani s 1 that is based on affinity chromatography using anti-Ani s 1 antibodies as ligands. The method was shown to produce nAni s 1 with a higher yield than the previously reported methods. Then, an attempt was made to express rAni s 1 in Escherichia coli as a His-tagged protein. rAni s 1 obtained as an inclusion body was solubilized in a solvent containing denaturing and reducing reagents and purified by nickel-chelate chromatography.

METHODS: The 429 bp DNA sequence of hGITR(aa27-165) was obtained from pGEM T-hGITR by PCR and then it was inserted into pQE30 plasmid to construct the prokaryotic expression plasmid pQE30-hGITR(aa27-165). pQE30-hGITR(aa27-165) was transformed into E.coli. The target fusion protein was expressed with the induction of Isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalacto- pyranoside (IPTG) and purified by Ni(2+)-NTA affinity chromatography column. The antiserum against hGITR(aa27-165) was obtained from the rabbits immunized with hGITR(aa27-165). The titer of pAb was detected by ELISA and the specificity of pAb was identified by Western blot. RESULTS: The prokaryotic expression plasmid pQE30-GITR(aa27-165) was constructed successfully. The culture condition in which the target fusion protein was highly expressed was found out: the optimal concentration of IPTG was 0.5 mmol/L, the culture temperature was 30 degree centigrade and the culture time was 6 h. The GITR(aa27-165) fusion protein was effectively expressed in E.coli as inclusion body. Soluble protein was obtained through denaturation and refolding procedure. The fusion protein was purified by Profinity IMAC Ni-Charged Resin affinity column with above 90% purity. The anti-GITR(aa27-165) pAb was prepared by immunizing the rabbits with the purified target fusion protein. ELISA showed the titer of pAb was 1:1.6x10(5). Western blot analysis confirmed anti-GITR(aa27-165) pAb was of good specificity. CONCLUSION: The fusion protein hGITR(aa27-165) with high purity has been obtained and the anti-hGITR(aa27-165) pAb with high titer and good specificity has been prepared.

Here, we report genetic and biochemical evidence to support this hypothesis using erythromycin as the inducing antibiotic. We show also that erythromycin increases the level of the erm(B) transcript by stalling the ribosome on the leader mRNA and thereby facilitating stabilization and processing of the mRNA. Erythromycin-induced mRNA stabilization and processing were observed with an ochre stop at codons 11 to 13 of the leader, but not with an ochre stop codon 10. This suggests that erythromycin does not stall the ribosome before codon 11 of the leader reaches the aminoacyl site. Secondary structure analyses of the erm(B) transcripts using in vitro and in vivo chemical probing techniques identified conformational changes in the transcripts that result from induction by erythromycin. These findings demonstrate that stalling of erythromycin-bound ribosomes at leader codon 11 causes the refolding of mRNA into a conformation in which the translational initiation site for the structural gene is unmasked and renders erm(B) translationally active.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18299414 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Min YH, Kwon AR, Yoon EJ, Shim MJ, Choi EC</author>\n    <category>Antimicrob Agents Chemother</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18299414</guid>\n</item>	0	1213831477

Temperature-induced unfolding-refolding of both TIM samples displayed hysteresis cycles, indicative of processes far from equilibrium. Kinetic studies showed that the rate constant for unfolding was about three-fold larger in the mutant than in wild-type TIM. However, more drastic changes were found in the kinetics of refolding: upon mutation, the rate-limiting step changed from a second-order (at submicromolar concentrations) to a first-order reaction. These results thus indicate that renaturation of yTIM occurs through a uni-bimolecular mechanism in which refolding of the monomer most likely begins at the C-terminal half of its polypeptide chain. From the temperature dependence of the refolding rate, we determined the change in heat capacity for the formation of the transition state from unfolded monomers. The value for the D225Q mutant, which is about 40% of the corresponding value for yTIM, would implicate the folding of only three quarters of a monomer chain in the transition state. Proteins 2008.

The scaffolding protein of bacteriophage SPP1 was engineered with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag (gp11-His(6)) and purified. The protein is an alpha-helical-rich molecule with a very elongated shape as found for internal scaffolding proteins from other phages. It is a 3.3 S tetramer of 93.6 kDa at micromolar concentrations. Intersubunit cross-linking of these tetramers generated preferentially covalently bound dimers, revealing that gp11-His(6) is structurally a dimer of dimers. Incubation at temperatures above 37 degrees C correlated with a reduction of its alpha-helical content and a less effective intersubunit cross-linking. Complete loss of secondary structure was observed at temperatures above 60 degrees C. Refolding of gp11-His(6) thermally denatured at 65 degrees C led to reacquisition of the protein native ellipticity spectrum but the resulting population of molecules was heterogeneous. Its hydrodynamic behavior was compatible with a mix of 3.3 S elongated tetramers ( approximately 90%) and a smaller fraction of 2.4 S dimers ( approximately 10%). This population of gp11-His(6) was competent to direct polymerization of the SPP1 major capsid protein gp13 into procapsid-like structures in a newly developed assembly assay in vitro. Although native tetramers were active in assembly, refolded gp11-His(6) showed enhanced binding to gp13 revealing a more active species for interaction with the major capsid protein than native gp11-His(6).</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18377930 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Poh SL, El Khadali F, Berrier C, Lurz R, Melki R, Tavares P</author>\n    <category>J Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18377930</guid>\n</item>	0	1213831415

For the N-terminal domain of the gene-3 protein of the filamentous phage fd (N2 domain), Pro161 resides at the tip of a beta hairpin and was found to be cis in the crystal structure of this protein. Here we show that Pro161 exists in both the cis and the trans conformations in the folded form of the N2 domain. We investigated how conformational folding and prolyl isomerization are coupled in the unfolding and refolding of N2 domain. A combination of single-mixing and double-mixing unfolding and refolding experiments showed that, in unfolded N2 domain, 7% of the molecules contain a cis-Pro161 and 93% of the molecules contain a trans-Pro161. During refolding, the fraction of molecules with a cis-Pro161 increases to 85%. This implies that 10.3 kJ mol(-1) of the folding free energy was used to drive this 75-fold change in the Pro161 cis/trans equilibrium constant during folding. The stabilities of the forms with the cis and the trans isomers of Pro161 and their folding kinetics could be determined separately because their conformational folding is much faster than the prolyl isomerization reactions in the native and the unfolded proteins. The energetic coupling between conformational folding and Pro161 isomerization is already fully established in the transition state of folding, and the two isomeric forms are thus truly native forms. The folding kinetics are well described by a four-species box model, in which the N2 molecules with either isomer of Pro161 can fold to the native state and in which cis/trans isomerization occurs in both the unfolded and the folded proteins.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18325533 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Jakob RP, Schmid FX</author>\n    <category>J Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18325533</guid>\n</item>	2	1213831452

The oxidative refolding of the confined lysozyme is biphasic in AOT reverse micelles. When the water-to-surfactant molar ratio (omega(0)) is 12.6, the relative activity of encapsulated lysozyme after refolding for 24 h in AOT reverse micelles increases 46% compared with that in bulk water. Furthermore, aggregation of lysozyme at a higher concentration (0.2 mM) in AOT reverse micelles at omega(0) of 6.3 or 12.6 is not observed; in contrast, the oxidative refolding of lysozyme in bulk water must be at a lower protein concentration (5 muM) in order to avoid a serious aggregation of the protein. For comparison, we have also investigated the effect of AOT on lysozyme activity and found that the residual activity of lysozyme decreases with increasing the concentration of AOT from 1 to 5 mM. When AOT concentration is larger than 2 mM, lysozyme is almost completely inactivated by AOT and most of lysozyme activity is lost. Together, our data demonstrate that AOT reverse micelles with suitable water-to-surfactant molar ratios are favorable to the oxidative refolding of reduced, denatured lysozyme at a higher concentration, compared with bulk water.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18377920 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Fan JB, Chen J, Liang Y</author>\n    <category>J Colloid Interface Sci</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18377920</guid>\n</item>	27	1213772629

Peptide bond conformation as well as puckering propensity can be manipulated by proper choice of ring substituents, e.g. C(gamma)-fluorination. Synthetic chemistry has routinely exploited ring-substituted proline analogs in order to change, modulate or control folding and stability of peptides. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In order to transmit this synthetic strategy to complex proteins, the ten proline residues of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were globally replaced by (4R)- and (4S)-fluoroprolines (FPro). By this approach, we expected to affect the cis/trans peptidyl-proline bond isomerization and pyrrolidine ring puckering, which are responsible for the slow folding of this protein. Expression of both protein variants occurred at levels comparable to the parent protein, but the (4R)-FPro-EGFP resulted in irreversibly unfolded inclusion bodies, whereas the (4S)-FPro-EGFP led to a soluble fluorescent protein. Upon thermal denaturation, refolding of this variant occurs at significantly higher rates than the parent EGFP. Comparative inspection of the X-ray structures of EGFP and (4S)-FPro-EGFP allowed to correlate the significantly improved refolding with the C(gamma)-endo puckering of the pyrrolidine rings, which is favored by 4S-fluorination, and to lesser extents with the cis/trans isomerization of the prolines. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We discovered that the folding rates and stability of GFP are affected to a lesser extent by cis/trans isomerization of the proline bonds than by the puckering of pyrrolidine rings. In the C(gamma)-endo conformation the fluorine atoms are positioned in the structural context of the GFP such that a network of favorable local interactions is established. From these results the combined use of synthetic amino acids along with detailed structural knowledge and existing protein engineering methods can be envisioned as a promising strategy for the design of complex tailor-made proteins and even cellular structures of superior properties compared to the native forms.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18301757 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Steiner T, Hess P, Bae JH, Wiltschi B, Moroder L, Budisa N</author>\n    <category>PLoS ONE</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18301757</guid>\n</item>	0	1213831471

Detection and isolation of CTL's are of importance for research on CTL immunity, and development of vaccines and adoptive immune therapy. Peptide-MHC tetramers have become important reagents for detection and enumeration of specific CTL's. Conventional peptide-MHC-tetramer production involves recombinant MHC production, in vitro refolding, biotinylation and tetramerization; each step followed by various biochemical steps such as chromatographic purification, concentration etc. Such cumbersome production protocols have limited dissemination and restricted availability of peptide-MHC tetramers effectively precluding large-scale screening strategies involving many different peptide-MHC tetramers. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have developed an approach whereby any given tetramer specificity can be produced within 2 days with very limited effort and hands-on time. The strategy is based on the isolation of correctly oxidized, in vivo biotinylated recombinant MHC I heavy chain (HC). Such biotinylated MHC I HC molecules can be refolded in vitro, tetramerized with streptavidin, and used for specific T cell staining-all in a one-pot reaction without any intervening purification steps. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We have developed an efficient "one-pot, mix-and-read" strategy for peptide-MHC tetramer generation, and demonstrated specific T cell straining comparable to a commercially available MHC-tetramer. Here, seven peptide-MHC tetramers representing four different human MHC (HLA) class I proteins have been generated. The technique should be readily extendable to any binding peptide and pre-biotinylated MHC (at this time we have over 40 different pre-biotinylated HLA proteins). It is simple, robust, and versatile technique with a very broad application potential as it can be adapted both to small- and large-scale production of one or many different peptide-MHC tetramers for T cell isolation, or epitope screening.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18301755 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Leisner C, Loeth N, Lamberth K, Justesen S, Sylvester-Hvid C, Schmidt EG, Claesson M, Buus S, Stryhn A</author>\n    <category>PLoS ONE</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18301755</guid>\n</item>	0	1213831469

Because TOR is further an interesting drug target in cancer research, we established an expression, purification, and refolding protocol for the FRB domain of human TOR (hFRB). hFRB is extracted from inclusion bodies, purified by reversed phase HPLC, and refolded by drop-wise dilution of the denatured protein into a native buffer.

Recombinant variants of the E1 ectodomain as well as E1 antigen preparations from virus lysates are commonly used to detect anti-Rubella immunoglobulins in human sera. Hitherto, recombinant E1 for diagnostic applications has been produced chiefly in eukaryotic expression systems. Here, we report the high-yield overproduction of an engineered E1 ectodomain in the Escherichia coli cytosol and its simple and convenient renaturation into a highly soluble and immunoreactive conformation. C-Terminal fusion to one or two units of the E. coli chaperone SlyD enhances expression, facilitates in vitro refolding, and improves the overall solubility of Rubella E1. As part of this fusion protein, the E1 ectodomain fragment of residues 201-432 adopts an immunoreactive fold, providing a promising tool for the sensitive and specific detection of anti-E1 IgG in Rubella serology. Two disulfide bonds in the membrane-adjacent part of the E1 ectodomain are sufficient to generate conformations with a high and specific antigenicity. The covalently attached chaperone modules do not impair antibody recognition and binding of Rubella E1 when assessed in a heterogeneous immunoassay. SlyD and related folding helpers are apparently generic tools for the expression and refolding of otherwise unavailable proteins of diagnostic or medical importance.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18330994 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Scholz C, Thirault L, Schaarschmidt P, Zarnt T, Faatz E, Engel AM, Upmeier B, Bollhagen R, Eckert B, Schmid FX</author>\n    <category>Biochemistry</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18330994</guid>\n</item>	17	1213831426

The abrupt change in the unfolding free energy surface and the ns time resolution allow us to observe a fast response on ns to mus time-scales, which we attribute to downhill unfolding, before a cross-over to ms kinetics. The downhill unfolding by a sub-population of folded proteins is induced through a shift of the barrier toward the native state. By adjusting the T-jump width, the effect of the initial (T(i)) and final (T(f)) temperature on the unfolding dynamics can be separated. From the amplitude of the fast downhill unfolding, the fractional population prepared at the unfolding transition state is obtained. This population increases with both T(i) and with T(f). A two-state kinetic analysis of the ms refolding provides thermodynamic information about the barrier height. By a combination of the fast and slow unfolding and folding parameters, a quasi-two-state kinetic analysis is performed to calculate the time-dependent population changes of the folded state. This calculation coincides with the experimentally obtained population changes at low temperature but deviations are found in the T-jump from 67 to 78 degrees C. Using temperature-dependent barrier height changes, a temperature Phi value analysis is performed. The result shows a decreasing trend of Phi(T) with temperature, which indicates an increase of the heterogeneity of the transition state. We conclude that ubiquitin unfolds along a well-defined pathway at low temperature which expands with increasing temperature to include multiple routes. Proteins 2008.

The Solanum nigrum osmotin-like protein (SnOLP) gene encodes a member of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, from the PR-5 sub-group, the last comprising several proteins with different functions, including antifungal activity. Based on deduced amino acid sequence of SnOLP, computer modeling produced a tertiary structure which is indicative of antifungal activity. RESULTS: To validate the potential antifungal activity of SnOLP, a hexahistidine-tagged mature SnOLP form was overexpressed in Escherichia coli M15 strain carried out by a pQE30 vector construction. The urea solubilized His6-tagged mature SnOLP protein was affinity-purified by immobilized-metal (Ni2+) affinity column chromatography. As SnOLP requires the correct formation of eight disulfide bonds, not correctly formed in bacterial cells, we adapted an in vitro method to refold the E. coli expressed SnOLP by using reduced:oxidized gluthatione redox buffer. This method generated biologically active conformations of the recombinant mature SnOLP, which exerted antifungal action towards plant pathogenic fungi (Fusarium solani f. sp. glycines, Colletotrichum spp., Macrophomina phaseolina) and oomycete (Phytophthora nicotiana var. parasitica) under in vitro conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Since SnOLP displays activity against economically important plant pathogenic fungi and oomycete, it represents a novel PR-5 protein with promising utility for biotechnological applications.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18334031 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Campos MD, Silva MS, Magalhaes CP, Ribeiro SG, D Sarto RP, Vieira EA, Grossi de Sa MF</author>\n    <category>Microb Cell Fact</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18334031</guid>\n</item>	2	1213831425

Ion exchange chromatography was used to purify the CypA mutant in a single step, and a high activity recovery of target protein with a high purity was achieved. Peptide fragments produced by trypsin proteolysis were applied to MALDI-TOF-MS, and searching results from the NCBI protein databank confirmed the protein attribution as well as the mutation sequence. Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity was assayed for the CypA mutant using tetrapeptide substrate Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide, and the calculated kcat/Km value was 1.5 x 106 M-1 s-1 at 10 degrees C, which was 10-fold lower than the previously reported constant for wild-type CypA. An Eyring plot was also carried out. Inhibition by cyclosporine A demonstrated that the IC50 value was 26.5 nM. Meanwhile the expected enhancement of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was quenched by the mutation. The effect of CypA mutant on accelerating protein refolding in vitro was investigated in ribonuclease A refolding process, and it was found that 10% slow phase could be catalyzed by CypA. The protein was subject to urea and GdmCl denaturation, where both activity and fluorescence served as structural probes. Activity recovery indicated this CypA mutant was extremely sensitive to GdmCl and the susceptibility to urea was increased. Low pH could also destabilize CypA. Furthermore the refolding of this CypA mutant itself was studied. Although the activity yield was nearly unchanged, the former proposed folding/assembly pathway might be altered. Fluorescence chart also demonstrated that the folding time was extended, and fast-folding and slow-folding analysis indicated the slow-folding rate constant presented a concentration dependence property denoting the autocatalysis of the foldase.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18333624 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Xu LR, Yan X, Luo M, Guan YX, Yao SJ</author>\n    <category>Biotechnol Prog</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18333624</guid>\n</item>	45	1213831425

The sol-gel pores constrain the protein to a volume that is the same size and shape as the folded native state accompanied by a few layers of water solvation. Denaturants such as low pH buffers can be diffused through the gel pores to the protein to initiate unfolding and refolding. Acid-induced unfolding was hindered by the steric constraints imposed by the gel pores such that more denaturing conditions were required to create the unfolded state within the gel than in solution. No new folding intermediates were observed. Refolding of myoglobin was not complete in millimolar pH 7 buffer alone. Addition of 25% glycerol to the pH 7 buffer resulted in nearly complete refolding, and the use of 1 M phosphate buffer resulted in complete refolding. The role of this co-solvent and salt in disrupting the ordered water surrounding the protein within the gel is discussed in light of the Hofmeister series and entropic trapping via a diminished hydrophobic effect within the gel. These results are consistent with the premises of folding models in which secondary and tertiary structure are considered to form within a compact conformation of the protein backbone.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18339762 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Peterson ES, Leonard EF, Foulke JA, Oliff MC, Salisbury RM, Kim DY</author>\n    <category>Biophys J</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18339762</guid>\n</item>	1	1213831425

In the kinetic intermediate, formed during the burst phase of the quench-flow experiment, protected amides and helical structure are found mainly in the regions corresponding to the G and H helices of the folded protein, and in parts of the E helix and CE loop regions, whereas in the equilibrium intermediate, amide protection and helical structure are seen in parts of the A and B helix regions, as well as in the G and H regions, and the E helix remains largely unfolded. These results suggest that the structure of the molten globule intermediate of apoleghemoglobin is more plastic than that of apomyoglobin, so that it is readily transformed depending on the solution conditions, particularly pH. Thus, in the case of apoleghemoglobin at least, the equilibrium molten globule formed under destabilizing conditions at acid pH is not a good model for the compact intermediate formed during kinetic refolding experiments. Our high-precision kinetic analysis also reveals an additional slow phase during the folding of apoleghemoglobin, which is not observed for apomyoglobin. Hydrogen exchange pulse-labeling experiments show that the slow-folding phase is associated with residues in the CE loop, which probably forms non-native structure in the intermediate that must be resolved before folding can proceed to completion.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18384808 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Nishimura C, Dyson HJ, Wright PE</author>\n    <category>J Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18384808</guid>\n</item>	2	1213831407

Several alpha-domains are known to be glycosylated by cytosolic glycosyl transferases, promoting bacterial attachment to mammalian cells. Here we describe the effect of glycosylation on the extracellular alpha-domain of the E. coli autotransporter Ag43alpha, which induces frizzy colony morphology and cell settling. We identify 16 glycosylation sites and suggest two possible glycosylation motifs for Ser and Thr. To our knowledge this is the first bacterial glycosylation sequence analysis. Glycosylation stabilizes against thermal and chemical denaturation and increases refolding kinetics. Unexpectedly, glycosylation also reduces the stabilizing effect of Ca2+ ions, removes the ability of Ca2+ to promote cell adhesion, reduces the ability of Ag43alpha-containing cells to form bacterial amyloid and increases the susceptibility of the resulting amyloid to proteolysis. In addition, our data indicate that Ag43alpha folds without a stable intermediate, unlike pertactin, indicating that autotransporters may arrive at the native state by a variety of different mechanisms despite a common overall structure. A small but significant fraction of Ag43alpha can survive intact in the periplasm if expressed without the beta-domain, suggesting that it is able to adopt a protease-resistant structure prior to translocation over the membrane. Our work demonstrates that glycosylation may play significant roles in structural and functional properties of bacterial autotransporters at many different levels.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18341480 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Knudsen SK, Stensballe A, Franzmann M, Westergaard UB, Otzen DE</author>\n    <category>Biochem J</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18341480</guid>\n</item>	7	1213831425

The abrupt change in the unfolding free energy surface and the ns time resolution allow us to observe a fast response on ns to mus time-scales, which we attribute to downhill unfolding, before a cross-over to ms kinetics. The downhill unfolding by a sub-population of folded proteins is induced through a shift of the barrier toward the native state. By adjusting the T-jump width, the effect of the initial (T(i)) and final (T(f)) temperature on the unfolding dynamics can be separated. From the amplitude of the fast downhill unfolding, the fractional population prepared at the unfolding transition state is obtained. This population increases with both T(i) and with T(f). A two-state kinetic analysis of the ms refolding provides thermodynamic information about the barrier height. By a combination of the fast and slow unfolding and folding parameters, a quasi-two-state kinetic analysis is performed to calculate the time-dependent population changes of the folded state. This calculation coincides with the experimentally obtained population changes at low temperature but deviations are found in the T-jump from 67 to 78 degrees C. Using temperature-dependent barrier height changes, a temperature Phi value analysis is performed. The result shows a decreasing trend of Phi(T) with temperature, which indicates an increase of the heterogeneity of the transition state. We conclude that ubiquitin unfolds along a well-defined pathway at low temperature which expands with increasing temperature to include multiple routes. Proteins 2008.

However, recent experimental data at low pH as well as molecular dynamic simulations have indicated that the folding process of SH3 probably is more complicated, and may involve intermediate states. Using both kinetic and equilibrium measurements we have obtained evidence that under native-like conditions the folding of the spectrin SH3 domain does not follow a classic two-state behaviour. The curvature we observed in the Chevron plots is a strong indication of a non-linear activation energy relationship due to the presence of high-energy intermediates. In addition, circular dichroism measurements indicated that refolding after thermal denaturation did not follow the same pattern as thermal unfolding but rather implied less cooperativity and that the refolding transition increased with increasing protein concentration. Further, NMR experiments indicated that upon refolding the SH3 domain gave rise to more than one conformation. Therefore, our results suggest that the folding of the SH3 domain of alphaII-spectrin does not follow a classical two-state process under high-salt conditions and neutral pH. Heterogeneous folding pathways, which can include folding intermediates as well as misfolded intermediates, might give a more reasonable insight into the folding behaviour of the alphaII-spectrin SH3 domain.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18358826 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Petzold K, Ohman A, Backman L</author>\n    <category>Arch Biochem Biophys</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18358826</guid>\n</item>	0	1213831424

While many in vitro conditions induce beta(2)m-amyloid formation from wild-type (wt) beta(2)m and while a number of structurally altered beta(2)m molecules are known to be conformationally unstable and amyloidogenic on their own, it is not known why beta(2)m-amyloid is generated in some dialysis patients. For many amyloid proteins it is known that divalent metal ions, especially Cu(2+), display strong binding and distinct destabilizing effects on protein conformation. The present study uses CE to assess conformational states of wt and cleaved beta(2)m (dK58-beta(2)m, beta(2)m cleaved at lysine-58, a modification found in the circulation of hemodialysis patients) in the presence of divalent metal ions. The experiments provide both qualitative and quantitative data showing the specific destabilizing effects of Cu(2+)-ions on the folding of wt beta(2)m. Both refolding after acid denaturation and solution structure of beta(2)m under otherwise native conditions are severely influenced by Cu(2+). An increased unfolding, aggregation, and induction of Congo red-reactive molecular species in Cu(2+)-incubated wt-beta(2)m could be demonstrated while the refolding kinetics of dK58-beta(2)m, already slower than the wt molecule, appeared not to be further decreased by Cu(2+). Given the interest in the actions of metal ions in other types of amyloidosis, including, e.g., Alzheimer's disease and the prion encephalopathies, the use of microelectrophoretic methods to monitor unfolding and refolding of biomolecules available in scarce amounts as shown in this study is an attractive option.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18383026 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> De Lorenzi E, Colombo R, Sabella S, Corlin DB, Heegaard NH</author>\n    <category>Electrophoresis</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18383026</guid>\n</item>	0	1213831411

The hDll1 (127-225) fragment was successfully expressed in E. coli as a GST fusion protein (GST-hDll1). The GST-hDll1 protein, which was expressed as inclusion bodies after induction by IPTG, was refolded and purified simultaneously using affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. The purified GST-hDll1 was of more than 95% purity, and had a molecular weight of 39kDa. Reporter assay showed that GST-hDll1 could activate a reporter gene that is dependent on Notch activation. Therefore, using the E. coli expression system and different chromatography systems, we successfully expressed, refolded, and purified a biologically active GST-hDll1, which might be potentially useful for therapy and studying the Notch pathway.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18367408 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Shi ZX, He F, Wang LL, Liang YM, Han H, Wang CZ, Zhao Q, Geng XD</author>\n    <category>Protein Expr Purif</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18367408</guid>\n</item>	45	1213772630

The oxidative refolding of the confined lysozyme is biphasic in AOT reverse micelles. When the water-to-surfactant molar ratio (omega(0)) is 12.6, the relative activity of encapsulated lysozyme after refolding for 24 h in AOT reverse micelles increases 46% compared with that in bulk water. Furthermore, aggregation of lysozyme at a higher concentration (0.2 mM) in AOT reverse micelles at omega(0) of 6.3 or 12.6 is not observed; in contrast, the oxidative refolding of lysozyme in bulk water must be at a lower protein concentration (5 muM) in order to avoid a serious aggregation of the protein. For comparison, we have also investigated the effect of AOT on lysozyme activity and found that the residual activity of lysozyme decreases with increasing the concentration of AOT from 1 to 5 mM. When AOT concentration is larger than 2 mM, lysozyme is almost completely inactivated by AOT and most of lysozyme activity is lost. Together, our data demonstrate that AOT reverse micelles with suitable water-to-surfactant molar ratios are favorable to the oxidative refolding of reduced, denatured lysozyme at a higher concentration, compared with bulk water.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18377920 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Fan JB, Chen J, Liang Y</author>\n    <category>J Colloid Interface Sci</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18377920</guid>\n</item>	27	1213831413

To understand this unique folding mechanism, we investigated the refolding processes of the P1-P1' cleaved forms of wildtype ovalbumin (cl-OVA) and the R339T mutant (cl-R339T). In the native conditions, cl-OVA is trapped as the stressed conformer, while cl-R339T attains the relaxed structure. Under urea-denaturing conditions, these cleaved proteins completely dissociated into the heavy (Gly1-Ala352) and light (Ser353-Pro385) chains. Upon refolding, the heavy chains of both proteins formed essentially the same initial burst refolding intermediates and then reassociated with the light chain counterparts. The reassociated intermediates both refolded into the native states with indistinguishable kinetics.

Effective fusion protein purification and refolding are described. The average yields of alpha and beta tubulin were 2.0 and 1.3 mg/l of culture respectively. The apparent molecular weight of each tubulin was estimated to be 55 kDa by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The tubulin monomers were found to be assembly competent using a standard dimerization assay, and also retained antigenicity with anti-His/T7 antibodies. The purified tubulins were polymerized to microtubule-like structures in the presence of 2 mM guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP).</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18391467 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Jang MH, Kim JM, Kalme S, Han JW, Yoo HS, Kim J, Koo BS, Kim SK, Yoon MY</author>\n    <category>Biosci Biotechnol Biochem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18391467</guid>\n</item>	132	1213831395

LTBSC and LTB were fed to rats and the ability to induce antigen-specific tolerance was tested. LTBSC inhibited the specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response and induced decreased antigen-specific in vivo and in vitro cell proliferation more efficiently than LTB.

Various studies have proved that supplementing recombinant human EGF (rhEGF) results in significant augmentation of wound healing. In the present work, a high level expression system with poly-arginine sequences was used for the production of recombinant human EGF (rhEGF) as inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were solubilized and the protein was refolded by using expanded-bed adsorption chromatography. The renatured protein was digested with appropriate concentration of trypsin and subsequently the digested rhEGF is purified by passing through ion-exchange chromatography (Toyopearl-SP) to obtain a biologically active protein. This process is the shortest process with reduced number of steps of purification, eliminates the usage of preparative reversed phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) for final purification, which is an expensive technique.

Various studies have proved that supplementing recombinant human EGF (rhEGF) results in significant augmentation of wound healing. In the present work, a high level expression system with poly-arginine sequences was used for the production of recombinant human EGF (rhEGF) as inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were solubilized and the protein was refolded by using expanded-bed adsorption chromatography. The renatured protein was digested with appropriate concentration of trypsin and subsequently the digested rhEGF is purified by passing through ion-exchange chromatography (Toyopearl-SP) to obtain a biologically active protein. This process is the shortest process with reduced number of steps of purification, eliminates the usage of preparative reversed phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) for final purification, which is an expensive technique. The purified protein was analyzed by RP-HPLC, showing a purity &gt;99% and size exclusion chromatography profile shows that there are minimal aggregates, with 99% renatured active protein.

C8 contains three genetically distinct subunits (C8alpha, C8beta, C8gamma) arranged as a disulfide-linked C8alpha-gamma dimer that is noncovalently associated with C8beta. C6, C7 C8alpha, C8beta, and C9 are homologous. All contain N- and C-terminal modules and an intervening 40-kDa segment referred to as the membrane attack complex/perforin (MACPF) domain.

Several hundred proteins with MACPF domains have been identified based on sequence similarity; however, the structure and function of most are unknown.

The alphaMACPF portion has the predicted CDC-like fold and shows two regions of interaction with C8gamma. One is in a previously characterized 19-residue insertion (indel) in C8alpha and fills the entrance to the putative C8gamma ligand-binding site. The second is a hydrophobic pocket that makes contact with residues on the side of the C8gamma beta-barrel.

TA treatment induced a transient increase in reactive oxygen species and a decrease in the intracellular glutathione contents. Non-reducing SDS-PAGE revealed that TA rapidly and selectively induced thiol oxidation and aggregation of Hsp90 and Hsp70, both in intact cells and in cell-free systems using purified recombinant proteins. Furthermore, TA inhibited the chaperon activity of Hsp90/Hsp70 complex in the luciferase refolding assay. N-acetylcysteine, a thiol antioxidant, prevented all of TA-induced effects, including oxidation of heat shock proteins, degradation of Hsp90 client proteins as well as apoptosis. In contrast, non-thiol antioxidants (trolox and vitamin C) were ineffective to prevent Hsp90 inhibition and cell death. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the TA inhibits the activity of Hsp90/Hsp70 chaperone complex, at least in part, by a direct thiol oxidation, which in turn leads to the destabilization and depletion of Hsp90 client-proteins, and thus causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. Therefore, TA can be considered as a new type of inhibitor of Hsp90/Hsp70 chaperone complex, which has the potential to be developed as a novel strategy for cancer treatment.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18442981 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Chen WY, Chang FR, Huang ZY, Chen JH, Wu YC, Wu CC</author>\n    <category>J Biol Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18442981</guid>\n</item>	5	1213831280

The aim of the study was to identify new important HDM allergens associated with allergic asthma. METHODS: A cDNA coding for a new mite allergen, designated Der p 21, was isolated using immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies from patients with allergic asthma out of a D. pteronyssinus expression cDNA library and expressed in Escherichia coli. RESULTS: Circular dichroism analysis of the purified allergen showed that rDer p 21 (14 726 Da) is one of the few mite allergens with an alpha-helical secondary structure. The protein exhibited high thermal stability and refolding capacity, and, as determined by small angle X-ray scattering, formed a dimer consisting of two flat triangles. rDer p 21 bound high levels of patients' IgE antibodies and showed high allergenic activity in basophil activation experiments. Rabbit anti-Der p 21 IgG antibodies inhibited mite-allergic patients' IgE binding and allowed the ultrastructural localization of the allergen in the midgut (epithelium, lumen and faeces) of D. pteronyssinus by immunogold electron microscopy. Der p 21 revealed sequence homology with group 5 mite allergens, but IgE and IgG reactivity data and cross-inhibition studies identified it as a new mite allergen. CONCLUSIONS: Der p 21 is a new important mite allergen which is liberated into the environment via faecal particles and hence may be associated with allergic asthma.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18445190 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Weghofer M, Dall'Antonia Y, Grote M, StÃ¶cklinger A, Kneidinger M, Balic N, Krauth MT, FernÃ¡ndez-Caldas E, Thomas WR, van Hage M, Vieths S, Spitzauer S, Horak F, Svergun DI, Konarev PV, Valent P, Thalhamer J, Keller W, Valenta R, Vrtala S</author>\n    <category>Allergy</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18445190</guid>\n</item>	23	1213831278

Here direct ultrafast kinetic measurements have been used to study the initial submillisecond (sub-ms) folding reaction of the small protein barstar. The cooperativity of the initial folding reaction has been explored by using two probes: fluorescence resonance energy transfer, through which the contraction of two intramolecular distances is measured, and the binding of 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid, through which the formation of hydrophobic clusters is monitored. A fast chain contraction is shown to precede the formation of hydrophobic clusters, indicating that the sub-ms folding reaction is not cooperative. The observed rate constant of the sub-ms folding reaction monitored by 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid fluorescence has been found to be the same in stabilizing conditions (low urea concentrations), in which specific structure is formed, and in marginally stabilizing conditions (higher urea concentrations), where virtually no structure is formed in the product of the sub-ms folding reaction. The observation that the folding rate is independent of the folding conditions suggests that the initial folding reaction occurs in the absence of a dominant free energy barrier. These results provide kinetic evidence that the formation of specific structure need not be slowed down by any significant free energy barrier during the course of a very fast protein folding reaction.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18523007 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Sinha KK, Udgaonkar JB</author>\n    <category>Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18523007</guid>\n</item>	0	1213772544

Here, we show that entrapment of the protein cytochrome c in wet, optically transparent, porous silica gel matrices has enabled a dramatic expansion, to days or weeks, of the folding time, allowing direct observation of the entire folding pathway using a combination of three spectroscopic techniques, far-ultraviolet circular dichroism, tryptophan fluorescence, and Soret absorption spectroscopy. During refolding in silica gels, collapse and helix formation occur in a stepwise manner, as observed in aqueous solution. Analysis of kinetics and transient spectra indeed reveals a sequence of four distinct intermediates with progressively increasing degrees of folding, two of which closely resemble those previously characterized in solution, namely, the early collapsed and the molten globule intermediates. The other two are the precollapsed and pre-molten globule intermediates that may escape detection by conventional kinetic methods. Interestingly, varying the strength of the gel network has a dramatic effect on the folding time, but no significant effect on the structural features of each folding intermediate, indicating that the interaction between the protein and gel matrix has no measurable effect on the folding pathway. These results better define the major pathway of cytochrome c folding. In addition, in this paper we present the results of the application of this method to a simple, apparent two-state folder ubiquitin, helping to interpret the results for cytochrome c.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18447365 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Shibayama N</author>\n    <category>Biochemistry</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18447365</guid>\n</item>	0	1213831264

Methods and Results: The molecular weight of phytase was estimated as 40 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A requirement of Ca(2+) ions was found essential both for refolding and activity of the enzyme. Bacillus phytase exhibited a specific activity of 16 U mg(-1) protein; it also revealed broad pH and temperature ranges of 5.0 to 8.0 and 25 to 70 degrees C, respectively. The K(m) value of phytase for hydrolysis of sodium phytate has been determined as 0.392 mmol l(-1). The activity of enzyme has been inhibited by EDTA. The enzyme exhibited ample thermostability upon exposure to high temperatures from 75 to 95 degrees C. After 9 h of cultivation of transformed E. coli in the bioreactor, the cell biomass reached 26.81 g wet weight (ww) per l accounting for 4289 U enzyme activity compared with 1.978 g ww per l producing 256 U activity in shake-flask cultures. In silico analysis revealed a beta-propeller structure of phytase. Conclusions: This is the first report of its kind on the purification and successful in vitro refolding of Bacillus phytase from the inclusion bodies formed in the transformed E. coli. Significance and Impact of the Study: Efficient and reproducible protocols for cloning, expression, purification and in vitro refolding of Bacillus phytase enzyme from the transformed E. coli have been developed. The novel phytase, with broad pH and temperature range, renaturation ability and substrate specificity, appears promising as an ideal feed supplement.

Independent refolding of several structurally diverse proteins by this approach has provided promising results regarding significant suppression of aggregation along with enhanced refolding yields. However, from the industrial point of view, some modifications seem to be essential for making the technique more efficient. In that regard and with a cost-cutting goal we designed, for the first time, a beta-cyclodextrin-polyurethane polymer to replace the soluble beta-cyclodextrin as the stripping agent for refolding of carbonic anhydrase. Our results indicated that under the optimally developed refolding environment, the denatured carbonic anhydrase was refolded with a yield of 75% using 15 mg/mL of the beta-cyclodextrin-polyurethane polymer, a yield near to stripping by soluble beta-CD. This new stripping approach seems to constitute an ideal approach for refolding of proteins at much lower industrial costs compared to stripping with soluble beta-cyclodextrin. However, further-improvements in solid-phase artificial chaperone assisted technique are demanded either through synthesizing better stripping agents or by optimizing and defining better refolding environments.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18521727 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Esmaeili MA, Yazdanparast R</author>\n    <category>Protein J</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18521727</guid>\n</item>	2	1213772545

The solubilized rhSCF can be easily refolded with simultaneous purification by ion exchange chromatography (IEC), with a specific activity of 7.8 x 10(5) IU x mg(-1), a purity of 96.3%, and a mass recovery of 43.0%.

We study two formulations, a system of essentially pure protein (with a trace of phosphate buffer) and a system formulated with trehalose in a 3:1 trehalose:hGH weight ratio. The extent of denaturation is measured by loss of secondary structure by FTIR, the loss of heat of denaturation by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and the fraction of protein aggregated by HPLC. We examine loss of structure on heating to the DSC onset of thermal denaturation and restoration of structure by cooling below the denaturation temperature and holding to (nominally) allow time for refolding, and we also examine restoration of structure upon dissolving and refreeze drying samples heated to selected temperatures in the denaturation range. We find that denaturation occurs only above the glass transition temperature, is highly cooperative, and is only reversible by redissolving the "denatured" formulated (trehalose) solid. Further, all measures of the extent of denaturation are in essential agreement.

Micoscale NMR was then used to screen a series of newly designed zwitterionic phosphocholine detergents for their ability to reconstitute membrane proteins, using the previously well characterized beta-barrel E. coli outer membrane protein OmpX as a test case. Fold screening was thus achieved with microgram amounts of uniformly (2)H, (15)N-labeld OmpX and affordable amounts of the detergents, and prescreening with SDS-gel electrophoresis ensured efficient selection of the targets for NMR studies.

Independent refolding of several structurally diverse proteins by this approach has provided promising results regarding significant suppression of aggregation along with enhanced refolding yields. However, from the industrial point of view, some modifications seem to be essential for making the technique more efficient. In that regard and with a cost-cutting goal we designed, for the first time, a beta-cyclodextrin-polyurethane polymer to replace the soluble beta-cyclodextrin as the stripping agent for refolding of carbonic anhydrase. Our results indicated that under the optimally developed refolding environment, the denatured carbonic anhydrase was refolded with a yield of 75% using 15 mg/mL of the beta-cyclodextrin-polyurethane polymer, a yield near to stripping by soluble beta-CD. This new stripping approach seems to constitute an ideal approach for refolding of proteins at much lower industrial costs compared to stripping with soluble beta-cyclodextrin.

The periplasmic binding protein, ferric binding protein (FbpA), is capable of transporting other trivalent cations, including Ga(3+), which, unlike Fe(3+), is not redox-active. Because of a similar size and charge as Fe(3+), Ga(3+) is widely used as a non-redox-active Fe(3+) substitute for studying metal complexation in proteins and bacterial populations. The investigations reported here elucidate the similarities and differences in FbpA sequestration of Ga(3+) and Fe(3+), focusing on metal selectivity and the resulting transport function. The thermodynamic binding constant for Ga(3+) complexed with FbpA at pH 6.5, in 50 mM 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid, 200 mM KCl, 5 mM KH(2)PO(4) was determined by UV-difference spectroscopy as [Formula: see text] This represents a 10(5)-fold weaker binding relative to Fe(3+) at identical conditions. The unfolding/refolding behavior of Ga(3+) and Fe(3+) holo-FbpA were also studied using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy technique, stability of unpurified proteins from rates of H/D exchange (SUPREX). This analysis indicates significant differences between Fe(3+) and Ga(3+) sequestration with regard to protein folding behavior.

Missense mutations in either of these chains that substitute a glycine residue in the ubiquitous X-Y-Gly repeat with a bulky amino acid leads to osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) of varying severity. These mutations have been studied in the past using collagen-like peptide homotrimers as a model system. However, homotrimers, which by definition will contain glycine mutations in all the three chains, do not accurately mimic the mutations in their native form and result in an exaggerated effect on stability and folding. In this article, we report the design of a novel model system based upon collagen-like heterotrimers that can mimic the glycine mutations present in either the alpha1 or alpha2 chains of type I collagen. This design utilizes an electrostatic recognition motif in three chains that can force the interaction of any three peptides, including AAA (all same), AAB (two same and one different), or ABC (all different) triple helices. Therefore, the component peptides can be designed in such a way that glycine mutations are present in zero, one, two, or all three chains of the triple helix. With this design, we for the first time report collagen mutants containing one or two glycine substitutions with structures relevant to native forms of OI. Furthermore, we demonstrate the difference in thermal stability and refolding half-life times between triple helices that vary only in the frequency of glycine mutations at a particular position.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18481852 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Gauba V, Hartgerink JD</author>\n    <category>J Am Chem Soc</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18481852</guid>\n</item>	38	1213831209

The widely studied GroEL chaperonin is a double-barreled complex that can trap non-native proteins in one of its two barrels. The ATP-driven binding of a GroES cap then results in a major structural change of the chamber where the substrate is trapped and initiates a refolding attempt. The two barrels operate anti-synchronously. The central region between the two barrels contains a high concentration of disordered protein chains, the role of which was thus far unclear. In this work we report a combination of atomistic and coarse-grained simulations that probe the structure and dynamics of the equatorial region of the GroEL/GroES chaperonin complex. Surprisingly, our simulations show that the equatorial region provides a translocation channel that will block the passage of folded proteins but allows the passage of secondary units with the diameter of an alpha-helix. We compute the free-energy barrier that has to be overcome during translocation and find that it can easily be crossed under the influence of thermal fluctuations. Hence, strongly non-native proteins can be squeezed like toothpaste from one barrel to the next where they will refold. Proteins that are already fairly close to the native state will not translocate but can refold in the chamber where they were trapped. Several experimental results are compatible with this scenario, and in the case of the experiments of Martin and Hartl, intra chaperonin translocation could explain why under physiological crowding conditions the chaperonin does not release the substrate protein.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18463703 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Coluzza I, De Simone A, Fraternali F, Frenkel D</author>\n    <category>PLoS Comput Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18463703</guid>\n</item>	0	1213831241

Linear, cyclic, and concatenated foldamers reveal that photoabsorption and excitation induces unfolding and refolding, generating colorful spectral switching from one spectral type to another. Foldamer architectures dictate the unfolding and refolding processes, and hence the spectral dynamics. As a result, linear tetramer exhibits active frame-to-frame spectral switching accompanying dramatic changes in colors, but a concatenated tetramer displays a multicolored composite spectrum with little or no spectral switching. Excited state dynamics causes spectral switching: an electronically decoupled PTDI monomer emits green fluorescence while electronically coupled PTDI pi-stacks emit red fluorescence, with longer pi-stacks emitting redder fluorescence. A key question we address is the excited-state delocalization length, or the exciton coherence length, in the pi-stacks, which has been proven difficult to measure directly. Using foldamers having controlled sequences, structures, and well-defined length and chromophore numbers, we have mapped out the exciton coherence length in pi-stacks. Single molecule fluorescence studies on chromophoric foldamers reveal that the maximum domain length is delocalized across just four pi-stacked PTDI dyes and no new pure color can be found for oligomers beyond the tetramer. Therefore, the range of fluorescent colors in pi-stacks is a function of the number of chromophores only up to the tetramer.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18461945 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Han JJ, Shaller AD, Wang W, Li AD</author>\n    <category>J Am Chem Soc</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18461945</guid>\n</item>	0	1213831237

In the mutant, a free thiol group of wild-type beta-lg at Cys121 was removed and two beta-lg molecules were linked by a disulfide bridge through Cys34 created at the dimer's interface. Under strongly native conditions at low concentrations of urea, the refolding yield of A34C/C121A beta-lg was low when monitored by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. However, under marginally native conditions, the yield improved notably, although the refolding was still slow. H-D exchange pulse labeling monitored using heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy indicated that A34C/C121A beta-lg forms a folding intermediate similar to monomeric C121A beta-lg in spite of its slow folding. These results indicate that the rapid formation of folding intermediates driven by local interactions occurs in a manner independent of the molecular size and that, if the non-native interactions are too strong, the kinetic trap is set, leading to a glasslike misfolded state.

However, the exact relationship between structural fluctuations and function is not well understood. In this work hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) are used for exploring the conformational dynamics of thermolysin. Amide HDX reflects the internal mobility of proteins; regions that undergo frequent unfolding-refolding show faster exchange than segments that are highly stable. Thermolysin is a zinc protease with an active site that is located between two lobes. Substrate turnover is associated with hinge bending that leads to a closed conformation. Product release regenerates the open form, such that steady-state catalysis involves a continuous closing/opening cycle. HDX/ESI-MS with proteolytic peptide mapping in the absence of substrate shows that elements in the periphery of the two lobes are most mobile. A comparison with previous X-ray data suggests that these peripheral regions undergo quite pronounced structural changes during the catalytic cycle. In contrast, active site residues exhibit only a moderate degree of backbone flexibility, and the central zinc appears to be in a fairly rigid environment. The presence of both rigid and moderately flexible elements in the active site may reflect a carefully tuned balance that is required for function. Interestingly, the HDX behavior of catalytically active thermolysin is indistinguishable from that of the free enzyme.

In an effort to identify such mechanisms, we have performed a detailed comparative study of the folding thermodynamics and kinetics of the ribosomal protein S16 isolated from a mesophilic (S16(meso)) and hyperthermophilic (S16(thermo)) bacterium by using a variety of biophysical methods. As basis for the study, the 2.0 A X-ray structure of S16(thermo) was solved using single wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing. Thermal unfolding experiments yielded midpoints of 59 and 111 degrees C with associated changes in heat capacity upon unfolding (DeltaC(p)(0)) of 6.4 and 3.3 kJ mol(-1) K(-1), respectively. A strong linear correlation between DeltaC(p)(0) and melting temperature (T(m)) was observed for the wild-type proteins and mutated variants, suggesting that these variables are intimately connected. Stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy shows that S16(meso) folds through an apparent two-state model, whereas S16(thermo) folds through a more complex mechanism with a marked curvature in the refolding limb indicating the presence of a folding intermediate. Time-resolved energy transfer between Trp and N-(4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-yl)methyl iodoacetamide of proteins mutated at selected positions shows that the denatured state ensemble of S16(thermo) is more compact relative to S16(meso). Taken together, our results suggest the presence of residual structure in the denatured state ensemble of S16(thermo) that appears to account for the large difference in quantified DeltaC(p)(0) values and, in turn, parts of the observed extreme thermal stability of S16(thermo). These observations may be of general importance in the design of robust enzymes that are highly active over a wide temperature span.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18471828 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Wallgren M, AdÃ©n J, Pylypenko O, Mikaelsson T, Johansson LB, Rak A, Wolf-Watz M</author>\n    <category>J Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18471828</guid>\n</item>	1	1213831233

This is an efficient but indirect test of the energy functions because decoy structures are typically generated either by sampling procedures or by a separate energy function. As a result, these decoys may not contain the global minimum structure that reflects the true folding accuracy of the energy functions. This paper proposes to assess energy functions by ab initio refolding of fully unfolded terminal segments with secondary structures while keeping the rest of the proteins fixed in their native conformations. Global energy minimization of these short unfolded segments, a challenging yet tractable problem, is a direct test of the energy functions. As an illustrative example, refolding terminal segments is employed to assess two closely related all-atom statistical energy functions, DFIRE (distance-scaled, finite, ideal-gas reference state) and DOPE (discrete optimized protein energy). We found that a simple sequence-position dependence contained in the DOPE energy function leads to an intrinsic bias toward the formation of helical structures. Meanwhile, a finer statistical treatment of short-range interactions yields a significant improvement in the accuracy of segment refolding by DFIRE. The updated DFIRE energy function yields success rates of 100% and 67%, respectively, for its ability to sample and fold fully unfolded terminal segments of 15 proteins to within 3.5 A global root-mean-squared distance from the corresponding native structures. The updated DFIRE energy function is available as DFIRE 2.0 upon request.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18469178 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Yang Y, Zhou Y</author>\n    <category>Protein Sci</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18469178</guid>\n</item>	17	1213831231

However, the exact relationship between structural fluctuations and function is not well understood. In this work hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) are used for exploring the conformational dynamics of thermolysin. Amide HDX reflects the internal mobility of proteins; regions that undergo frequent unfolding-refolding show faster exchange than segments that are highly stable. Thermolysin is a zinc protease with an active site that is located between two lobes. Substrate turnover is associated with hinge bending that leads to a closed conformation. Product release regenerates the open form, such that steady-state catalysis involves a continuous closing/opening cycle. HDX/ESI-MS with proteolytic peptide mapping in the absence of substrate shows that elements in the periphery of the two lobes are most mobile. A comparison with previous X-ray data suggests that these peripheral regions undergo quite pronounced structural changes during the catalytic cycle. In contrast, active site residues exhibit only a moderate degree of backbone flexibility, and the central zinc appears to be in a fairly rigid environment. The presence of both rigid and moderately flexible elements in the active site may reflect a carefully tuned balance that is required for function. Interestingly, the HDX behavior of catalytically active thermolysin is indistinguishable from that of the free enzyme. This result is consistent with the view that catalytically relevant motions preexist in the resting state and that enzyme function can only be performed within the limitations given by the intrinsic dynamics of the protein.

In this report, we present evidence that Sse1 is required for signaling through the cell integrity pathway via partnership with Hsp90 and the terminal MAP kinase Slt2. We found that sse1Delta and sti1Delta mutant cells share the typical cell integrity mutant phenotypes of osmoremediated temperature-sensitive growth and sensitivity to cell wall-damaging agents. Sse1 binds to Slt2 in vivo and similar to Hsp90 mutants, Slt2 stability and phosphorylation is not compromised in sse1Delta cells, whereas activation of the downstream transcription factor Rlm1 is abolished. In addition to Rlm1, Slt2 activates the Swi4/Swi6 heterodimer SBF in response to cell wall damage. SSE1 displayed dramatic synthetic phenotypes when disrupted in combination with mutations in SBF and the related Mbp1/Swi6 heterodimer MBF, characterized by severe growth and morphological defects. These defects were reversed by restoration of Hsp70 NEF activity, providing a mechanistic model wherein Sse1 functionally partners with Hsp90 as an Hsp70 NEF to promote client protein maturation and interaction with downstream effectors.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18478233 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Shaner L, Gibney PA, Morano KA</author>\n    <category>Curr Genet</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18478233</guid>\n</item>	1	1213831226

Although the persistence of the protein activity in the SDS/MPD mixture was clearly established, preservation of their structure was only speculative until now. RESULTS: In this paper, a detailed X-ray study addresses the pending question. Crystals of hen egg-white lysozyme were grown for the first time in the presence of MPD and denaturing concentrations of SDS. Depending on crystallization conditions, tetragonal crystals in complex with either SDS or MPD were collected. The conformation of both structures was very similar to the native lysozyme and the obtained complexes of SDS-lysozyme and MPD-lysozyme give some insights in the interplay of protein-SDS and protein-MPD interactions. CONCLUSIONS: This study clearly established the preservation of the enzyme structure in a SDS/MPD mixture. It is hypothesized that high concentrations of MPD would change the properties of SDS and lower or avoid interactions between the denaturant and the protein. These structural data therefore support the hypothesis that MPD avoids disruption of the enzyme structure by SDS and can protect proteins from SDS denaturation.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18522744 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Michaux C, Pouyez J, Wouters J, Prive GG</author>\n    <category>BMC Struct Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18522744</guid>\n</item>	4	1213772543

In this paper, expression of recombinant kiwi pectin methylesterase inhibitor (PMEI) was carried out in Escherichia coli, and the target protein was expressed in the form of inclusion bodies. The expression level reached 46% of total cell protein. Then the fusion protein was purified by nickel ion metal affinity chromatography, and the purity was finally up to 98%. After refolding in GSH/GSSG redox system, recombinant PMEI not only could efficiently inhibit PMEs from eight different plants, but could remain effective inhibitor activity in the pH 3.0-10.0 and 20-40 degrees C.

The deleterious effects of heavy metal ions have hitherto been attributed to their interactions with specific, particularly susceptible native proteins. Here, we report an as yet not described mode of heavy metal toxicity. Cd(2+), Hg(2+) and Pb(2+) proved to inhibit very efficiently the spontaneous refolding of chemically denatured proteins by forming high-affinity multi-dentate complexes with thiol and other functional groups (IC(50) in the nanomolar range). With similar efficacy, the heavy metal ions inhibited the chaperone-assisted refolding of chemically denatured and heat-denatured proteins. Thus, the toxic effects of heavy metal ions may result as well from their interaction with the more readily accessible functional groups of proteins in nascent and other non-native form. The toxic scope of heavy metals seems to be substantially larger than assumed so far.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18501191 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Sharma SK, Goloubinoff P, Christen P</author>\n    <category>Biochem Biophys Res Commun</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18501191</guid>\n</item>	15	1214590101

Refolding proteins into native conformations from inclusion bodies could significantly increase the number of protein targets that can be taken on to structural studies. This chapter presents a simple assay for screening insoluble protein targets and identifying those that are most amenable to refolding. The assay is based on the observation that when proteins are refolded while bound to metal affinity resin, misfolded proteins are generally not eluted by imidazole.

Mutations resulting in amino acid changes within p53 result in a loss of activity and consequent changes in expression of genes that regulate DNA repair and cell cycle progression. Replacement of p53 using protein therapy would restore p53 function in p53-deficient tumor cells, with a consequence of tumor cell death and tumor regression. p53 functions in a tetrameric form in vivo. Here, we refolded a wild-type, full-length p53 from inclusion bodies expressed in Escherichia coli as a stable tetramer. The tetrameric p53 binds to p53-specific DNA and, when transformed into a p53-deficient cancer cell line, induced apoptosis of the transformed cells. Next, using the same expression and refolding technology, we produced a stable tetramer of recombinant gonadotropin-releasing hormone-p53 fusion protein (GnRH-p53), which traverses the plasma membrane, slows proliferation, and induces apoptosis in p53-deficient, GnRH-receptor-expressing cancer cell lines. In addition, we showed a time-dependent binding and internalization of GnRH-p53 to a receptor-expressing cell line. We conclude that the GnRH-p53 fusion strategy may provide a basis for constructing an effective cancer therapeutic for patients with tumors in GnRH-receptor-positive tissue types.

Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy performed on oligomers of both PcrV and LcrV revealed the presence of distinct structures with approximate internal and external diameters of 3-4 and 8-10 nm, respectively. PcrV's C-terminal helix, alpha12, and notably the hydrophobic residues Val255, Leu262 and Leu276 located within this helix, were shown to be crucial for oligomerization. Moreover, the corresponding mutant proteins produced in P. aeruginosa were found to be non-functional in in vivo type III-dependent cytotoxicity assays by directly affecting the correct assembly of PopB/D translocon within the host cell membranes.

Here, the physiological consequences of overexpression of GrpE in wild-type Escherichia coli MC4100 were examined. Overexpression of GrpE resulted in defects in cell division and growth, but overexpression of GrpE-G122D, which carries the G122D point mutation resulting in impaired interaction with DnaK, did not; this indicated that the effect of GrpE overexpression could be related to the DnaK chaperone function. Phase-contrast and fluorescence micrographs suggested that the N-terminal GFP-fused GrpE was colocalized with DnaK on the surface of inclusion bodies. An in vitro luciferase-refolding activity assay using purified DnaK, DnaJ and GrpE proteins demonstrated that high concentrations of GrpE significantly inhibited DnaK-mediated refolding. Furthermore, cell-free extracts from wild-type cells and GrpE-G122D-overexpressing cells significantly enhanced the refolding of luciferase. In the GrpE-overexpressing cells, abnormal localization of the cell-division protein FtsZ was observed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. In conclusion, the overexpression of GrpE caused a defect in the functionality of the DnaK chaperone system; this would result in filamentous morphology via abnormalities in the cell-division machinery.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18599817 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Sugimoto S, Saruwatari K, Higashi C, Sonomoto K</author>\n    <category>Microbiology</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18599817</guid>\n</item>	6	1215263162

The tryptophan at position 12 has been shown to be essential for the cooperativity of the re-folding process, and several lines of evidence from earlier work had suggested that it was the aromatic quadrupole that was responsible for this. In order to define more precisely what physico-chemical properties of tryptophan brought about the unique behaviour of this peptide, non-proteogenic aromatic amino acids have been selected based on desired alterations in quadrupole moment, electrostatic potential surface and binding energy to ions.

The tryptophan at position 12 has been shown to be essential for the cooperativity of the re-folding process, and several lines of evidence from earlier work had suggested that it was the aromatic quadrupole that was responsible for this. In order to define more precisely what physico-chemical properties of tryptophan brought about the unique behaviour of this peptide, non-proteogenic aromatic amino acids have been selected based on desired alterations in quadrupole moment, electrostatic potential surface and binding energy to ions. These were built into the peptide in the place of tryptophan and their effect on switch behaviour examined.

To obtain a high-resolution structure of this channel, human VDAC protein isoform I was overproduced in Escherichia coli.

Functionally, VDAC is involved in the limited exchange of ATP, ADP and small hydrophilic molecules across the outer membrane. Moreover, there is compelling evidence that VDAC isoforms in mammals may act in the cross-talk between mitochondria and the cytoplasm by direct interaction with enzymes involved in energy metabolism and proteins involved in mitochondrial-induced apoptosis. To obtain a high-resolution structure of this channel, human VDAC protein isoform I was overproduced in Escherichia coli.

To manipulate the folding barriers, we have designed a family of mutants in which stabilizing substitutions have been introduced incrementally on the solvent-exposed surface of the main alpha-helix (residues 23-34), which has a low intrinsic helical propensity in the native sequence. Although the U --&gt; I and I --&gt; N transitions are not clearly delineated in the kinetics of wt-Ub, we show that an intermediate becomes highly populated and more clearly resolved as the predicted stability of the helix increases. The observed acceleration in the rate of folding correlates with helix stability and is consistent with the I-state representing a productive rather than misfolded state. A Leffler analysis of the effects on kinetics of changes in stability within the family of helix mutants results in a biphasic correlation in both the refolding and unfolding rates that suggest a shift from a nucleation-condensation mechanism (weakly stabilized helix) toward a diffusion-collision model (highly stabilized helix). Through the introduction of helix-stabilizing mutations, we are able to engineer a well-resolved I-state on the folding pathway of ubiquitin which is likely to be structurally distinct from that which is only weakly populated on the folding pathway of wild-type ubiquitin.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18616284 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Rea AM, Simpson ER, Crespo MD, Searle MS</author>\n    <category>Biochemistry</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18616284</guid>\n</item>	23	1218538315

NudC is an evolutionarily conserved protein of undetermined function that associates with microtubules and interacts with several key regulators of mitosis, such as polo-kinase 1 (Plk1) and dynein. NudC is essential for proper mitotic progression, and homologs have been identified in species ranging from fungi to humans. In this paper, we report the characterization of the Caenorhabditis elegans NudC homolog, NUD-1, as a protein exhibiting molecular chaperone activity. All NudC/NUD-1 proteins share a conserved p23/HSP20 domain predicted by three-dimensional modeling [Garcia-Ranea, Mirey, Camonis, Valencia, FEBS Lett 529(2-3):162-167, 2002]. We demonstrate that nematode NUD-1 is able to prevent the aggregation of two substrate proteins, citrate synthase (CS) and luciferase, at stoichiometric concentrations. Further, NUD-1 also protects the native state of CS from thermal inactivation by significantly reducing the inactivation rate of this enzyme. To further determine if NUD-1/substrate complexes were productive or simply "dead-end" unfolding intermediates, a luciferase refolding assay was utilized. Following thermal denaturation, rabbit reticulocyte lysate and ATP were added and luciferase activity measured. In the presence of NUD-1, nearly all of the luciferase activity was regained, indicating that unfolded intermediates complexed with NUD-1 could be refolded. These studies represent the first functional evidence for a member of this mitotically essential protein family as having chaperone activity and facilitates elucidation of the role such proteins play in chaperone complexes utilized in cell division.

To better defined their mechanism of chaperone action, we used hydrogen/deuterium exchange and mass spectrometry (HXMS) to monitor conformational changes during complex formation between the structurally defined sHSPs, pea PsHsp18.1 and wheat TaHsp16.9, and the heat denatured model substrates malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and firefly luciferase (Luc). Remarkably, we found that even when complexed with substrate the highly dynamic local structure of the sHSPs, especially in the N-terminal arm (&gt;70% exchange in 5 s), remains unchanged. These results, coupled with sHSP-substrate complex stability indicate sHSPs do not adopt new secondary structure when binding substrate and suggest sHSPs are tethered to substrate at multiple sites that are locally dynamic, a feature which likely facilitates recognition and refolding of sHSP-bound substrate by the Hsp70/DnaK chaperone system. Both substrates were found to be stabilized in a partially unfolded state that is observed only in the presence of sHSP. Furthermore, peptide level HXMS showed MDH was substantially protected in two core regions (residues 95-156 and 228-252), which overlap with the MDH structure protected in the GroEL-bound MDH refolding intermediate. Significantly, despite differences in the size and structure of TaHsp16.9-MDH and PsHsp18.1-MDH complexes, peptide level HXMS patterns for MDH in both complexes are virtually identical, indicating that stabilized MDH thermal unfolding intermediates are not determined by identity of the sHSP.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18621732 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Cheng G, Basha E, Wysocki VH, Vierling E</author>\n    <category>J Biol Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18621732</guid>\n</item>	15	1218803458

Binding of the CBD to Avicel was inhibited by carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), but not by barley beta-glucan and glucose at concentration of 0.1% and 0.5%. Kinetic analysis showed both the turnover rate (k(cat)) and the catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) of Egl330 increased for the substrate CMC compared to Egl499.

The target FHA2 protein is the full ectodomain construct of the influenza virus hemagglutinin protein which catalyzes fusion between the viral and the cellular endosomal membranes during infection. The high yield of FHA2 was achieved by: (1) initial growth in rich medium to A(600) approximately 8 followed by a switch to minimal medium and induction of protein expression; and (2) obtaining protein both from purification of the detergent-soluble lysate and from solubilization, purification, and refolding of inclusion bodies. The high cell density was achieved after optimization of pH, oxygenation, and carbon source and concentration, and the refolding protocol was optimized using circular dichroism spectroscopy. For a single residue of membrane-associated FHA2 that was obtained from purification and refolding of inclusion bodies, native conformation was verified by the (13)CO chemical shifts measured using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18640277 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Curtis-Fisk J, Spencer RM, Weliky DP</author>\n    <category>Protein Expr Purif</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18640277</guid>\n</item>	86	1220082984

The rate of unfolding was found to be higher at lower surface concentrations, pH 4, higher ionic strengths, higher TFE and DTT concentrations. In contrast, earlier results showed that beta lactoglobulin unfolded slower and exhibited only an initial rapid and a subsequent slow unfolding phase.

Interactions were computed using an empirical potential function, where the parameters have been optimized to account for the different accessibilities of the spin-label pseudoatoms to the surrounding environment. This approach, "Pseudoatom-Driven Solvent Accessibility Refinement" (PaDSAR) was validated by refolding distorted conformations of the Streptomyces lividans potassium channel (KcsA), corresponding to a range of 2-30 A root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) away from the native structure. MD simulations based on up to58 EPR restraints derived from spin-label mutants were able to converge towards the native structure within 1-3 A RMSD with minimal computational cost. Use of energy-based ranking and structure similarity clustering as selection criteria helped in the convergence and identification of correctly folded structures from a large number of simulations.

Attempts to obtain heterologous overexpression of this enzyme in Escherichia coli system were not satisfactory. The EstA protein was expressed as inclusion bodies, most of that were inactive after purification step, and the recovery of esterolytic activity was very low after refolding. Based on the sequence analysis we found that the esterase EstA gene is clustered with three genes encoding components of ABC transport system. These genes, designated abc1, abc2, and abc3 encode an ATP-binding protein (ABC1) and two permease proteins (ABC2 and ABC3). In present study, to obtain larger amounts of the active cold-adapted EstA esterase from Pseudoalteromonas sp. 643A, we designed a two-plasmid E. coli expression system where the gene encoding EstA enzyme was cloned into pET30b(+) expression vector and three genes encoding components of ABC transport system were cloned into pACYC-pBAD vector. It was shown that the created expression system was useful for extracellular production of active EstA enzyme which was purified from the culture medium. In the presence of all the three transporter proteins the secretion of EstA was at the highest level. When one or two of these components were missing, EstA secretion was also possible, but not so effective. It indicates that ABC2 and ABC3 proteins of Pseudoalteromonas sp. 643A could be replaced with their homologous proteins of E. coli.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18700165 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> DÅ‚ugoÅ‚Ä™cka A, CieÅ›liÅ„ski H, Turkiewicz M, BiaÅ‚kowska AM, Kur J</author>\n    <category>Protein Expr Purif</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18700165</guid>\n</item>	15	1220614217

The protein has been heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli in fed-batch cultivations at different temperatures (30, 37, and 40 degrees C) as well as induction regimes that guaranteed distinct product formation rates and ratios of soluble to aggregated protein. Additionally, shake flask cultivations at 20, 30, and 37 degrees C were performed. IBs were sampled during the whole bioprocess and structural analysis was performed by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FT-IR) spectroscopy. This work clearly demonstrates that the tested production regimes and rates had no impact on the IB structure, which was characterized by decreased alpha-helical and increased and modified beta-sheet contents compared to the native protein.

Clearly, bacterial expression systems offer ease of maneuverability with respect to large-scale production of recombinant proteins, while, a baculovirus expression system ensures proper protein modifications, processing, and refolding of complex proteins. Despite these advantages, mammalian cells remain the preferred host for many eukaryotic proteins of pharmaceutical importance, particularly, those requiring post-translational modifications. Recently, the single-celled slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum (Dd), has emerged as a promising eukaryotic host for the expression of a variety of heterologous recombinant eukaryotic proteins. This organism possesses the complex cellular machinery required for orchestrating post-translational modifications similar to the one observed in higher eukaryotes. This review summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of Dictyostelium as an alternate system compared to other well-established expression systems. The key lessons learned from the expression of human recombinant proteins in this system are reviewed. Also, the strengths, weaknesses, and challenges associated with industrial-scale production of proteins in Dd expression system are discussed.-Arya, R., Bhattacharya, A., Saini, K. S.

In this study we have employed novel mass spectrometry techniques to investigate the changes in quaternary structure associated with this switch from chaperone to adjuvant of aggregation. We have replicated the oligomeric rearrangements observed for in vivo disease-related modifications, without altering the protein sequence, by refolding the alpha-crystallins in vitro.

Clearly, bacterial expression systems offer ease of maneuverability with respect to large-scale production of recombinant proteins, while, a baculovirus expression system ensures proper protein modifications, processing, and refolding of complex proteins. Despite these advantages, mammalian cells remain the preferred host for many eukaryotic proteins of pharmaceutical importance, particularly, those requiring post-translational modifications. Recently, the single-celled slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum (Dd), has emerged as a promising eukaryotic host for the expression of a variety of heterologous recombinant eukaryotic proteins. This organism possesses the complex cellular machinery required for orchestrating post-translational modifications similar to the one observed in higher eukaryotes. This review summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of Dictyostelium as an alternate system compared to other well-established expression systems. The key lessons learned from the expression of human recombinant proteins in this system are reviewed. Also, the strengths, weaknesses, and challenges associated with industrial-scale production of proteins in Dd expression system are discussed.-Arya, R., Bhattacharya, A., Saini, K. S.

In a previous study, the Fab fragment of the antibody was fused to a 38 kDa truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin A, PE38, to make Fab- PE38, where PE38 is fused to the Fd fragment of the Fab domain. This parent monomer molecule, Fab-PE38, had no cysteine in the hinge region, and it could not make a disulfide bond to form a disulfide bond bridged homodimer [7]. In this study, we constructed three different kinds of divalent Fab-toxin fusion homodimers where the toxin is fused to the light chain of Fab, (Fab-PE38fl)2. In addition to the PE38 toxin fused to the light chain, these three molecules have different hinge sequences h1, h2, and h3 making Fabh1-, Fabh2-, and Fabh3-PE38fl monomers, respectively. These hinges contain only one cysteine on different positions of the hinge sequence. The disulfide bond between the hinge region of two monomers forms homodimers (Fabh1-PE38fl)2, (Fabh2-PE38fl)2, and (Fabh3- PE38fl)2. The refolding yields of these dimers were 5- 16-fold higher than a previously constructed dimer where the PE38 was fused to the Fd fragment (Fabh1-PE38)2 [8]. Our data suggest that the steric repulsion between the two PE38s in (Fabh1-PE38)2 during disulfide bridge formation is relieved by fusing it at the end of the light chain. The best cytotoxicity value of these dimers showed about 2.5-fold higher on an MCF7 cell line than that of the monovalent reference molecule in ng/ml scale, which is 15-fold higher in pM scale.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18756111 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Won J, Choe M</author>\n    <category>J Microbiol Biotechnol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18756111</guid>\n</item>	27	1221293468

An Hsp104-binding peptide selected from solid phase arrays enhanced the refolding of a firefly luciferase-peptide fusion protein. Analysis of peptide binding using tryptophan fluorescence revealed two distinct binding sites, one in each AAA+ module of Hsp104. As a further indication of the relevance of peptide binding to Hsp104 mechanism, we found that it competes with the binding of a model unfolded protein, reduced carboxymethylated alpha-lactalbumin. Inactivation of the pore loops in either AAA+ module prevented stable peptide and protein binding. However, when the loop in the first AAA+ was inactivated, stimulation of the ATPase turnover in second AAA+ module of this mutant was abolished. Drawing on these data, we propose a detailed mechanistic model of protein unfolding by Hsp104 in which an initial unstable interaction involving the loop in the first AAA+ module simultaneously promotes penetration of the substrate into the second axial channel binding site and activates ATP turnover in the second AAA+ module.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18755692 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Lum R, Niggemann M, Glover JR</author>\n    <category>J Biol Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18755692</guid>\n</item>	12	1221557726

One of them (MLuc39) was obtained in an active monomeric form with a high yield. The luciferase bioluminescence is found to be initiated not only by free coelenterazine, but also by Ca(2+)-dependent coelenterazine-binding protein (CBP) of Renilla muelleri on Ca(2+) addition. The use of CBP as a "substrate" provides higher light emission and simultaneously the lower level of background. The high purity MLuc39 can be detected down to attomol with a linear range extending over 5 orders of magnitude. The MLuc39 reveals also a high stability towards heating and chemical modification; the chemically synthesized biotinylated derivatives of the luciferase preserve 35-40 % of the initial activity.

The zeta class GST from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtGSTZ) can efficiently degrade dichloroacetic acid (DCA), which is a common carcinogenic contaminant in drinking water. Ser73 in AtGSTZ is a conserved residue at Glutathione binding site (G-site). Compared with the equivalent residues in other GSTs, the catalytic and structural properties of Ser73 were poorly investigated. In this article, site-saturation mutagenesis was performed to characterize the detailed role of Ser73. The DCA dechlorinating (DCA-DC) activity showed that most of the mutants had less than 3% of the wild-type activity, except S73T and S73A showing 43.48% and 21.62% of the wild-type activity, respectively, indicating that position 73 in AtGSTZ showed low mutational substitutability. Kinetic experiments revealed that mutants S73T, S73A, and S73G showed low binding affinity and catalytic efficiency toward DCA, 1.8-, 3.1-, and 10.7-fold increases in K(m)(DCA) values and 4.0-, 9.6-, and 34.1-fold decreases in K(cat-)(DCA)/K(m)(DCA) values, respectively, compared to the wild type. Thermostability and refolding experiments showed that the wild type maintained more thermostability and recovered activity. These results demonstrated the important role of Ser73 in catalytic activity and structural stability of the enzyme. Such properties of Ser73 could be particularly crucial to the molecular evolution of AtGSTZ and might, therefore, help explain why Ser73 is conserved in all GSTs. This conclusion might provide insights into the directed evolution of the DCA-DC activity of AtGSTZ.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18721788 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Tao S, Chen X, Liu J, Ming M, Chong N, Chen D</author>\n    <category>J Genet Genomics</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18721788</guid>\n</item>	0	1220164580

One of them (MLuc39) was obtained in an active monomeric form with a high yield. The luciferase bioluminescence is found to be initiated not only by free coelenterazine, but also by Ca(2+)-dependent coelenterazine-binding protein (CBP) of Renilla muelleri on Ca(2+) addition. The use of CBP as a "substrate" provides higher light emission and simultaneously the lower level of background. The high purity MLuc39 can be detected down to attomol with a linear range extending over 5 orders of magnitude. The MLuc39 reveals also a high stability towards heating and chemical modification; the chemically synthesized biotinylated derivatives of the luciferase preserve 35-40 % of the initial activity.

This recombinant plasminogen deletion mutant, Delta(K2-K5)Pg, was produced in the form of inclusion bodies at the yield of up to 200 mg/l in an Escherichia coli T7 expression system. Following protein refolding and purification on lysine-Sepharose, the conversion of the recombinant molecule Delta(K2-K5)Pg to the active enzyme mutant Delta(K2-K5)Pm by plasminogen activators was evaluated, and functional characteristics of the simplified plasmin were studied. Properties of Delta(K2-K5)Pg were similar to native, human plasma-derived plasminogen. Delta(K2-K5)Pg effectively bound epsilon-aminocaproic acid (K(d) = 11.3 +/- 2.3 muM) and fibrin (C(50) approximately 0.3 muM). The plasminogen activators streptokinase, urokinase, and tissue plasminogen activator effectively converted the recombinant zymogen Delta(K2-K5)Pg to the active recombinant enzyme, Delta(K2-K5)Pm. Additionally, Delta[K2-K5]Pm was rapidly inhibited by alpha(2)-antiplasmin (1.1 +/- 0.1 x 10(7) M(-1)s(-1)) and alpha(2)-macroglobulin (7.6 +/- 0.6 x 10(5) M(-1)s(-1)). In an in-vitro model, Delta(K2-K5)Pm demonstrated fibrinolytic potency comparable to human plasma-derived plasmin. Because of their unique biochemistry, including fibrin-binding properties and rapid inhibition by alpha(2)-antiplasmin, both native plasmin and a simplified deletion mutant of plasmin are potentially safe and effective direct thrombolytic agents for various thrombotic conditions. Further studies evaluating the in-vivo pharmacologic safety and clinical efficacy of this simplified plasmin (i.e. Delta[K2-K5]Pm) are warranted.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18766256 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Hunt JA, Petteway SR, Scuderi P, Novokhatny V</author>\n    <category>Thromb Haemost</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18766256</guid>\n</item>	4	1222852363

Its precise function is unknown, although it seems to enhance the complement-activating capacity of MASP-2, a related enzyme. MASP-1 has also been implicated as playing a role in blood coagulation. It is mostly found associated with mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and ficolins. Early attempts to crystallize MASP-1 failed because of the inhomogeneity of the purified material. MASP-1 was shown by acidic nondenaturing PAGE to be composed of differently charged species, which are most likely to be the products of deamidation occurring during the refolding procedure. Sequential cation-exchange and anion-exchange chromatography resulted in a homogeneous material, which was successfully crystallized. The best crystal diffracted to 2.55 A resolution and belonged to space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 68.4, b = 70.4, c = 121.4 A.

Fibrillar Abeta degradation in MDM is sensitive to lysosomal and insulin degrading enzyme inhibitors but insensitive to proteasomal and neprilysin inhibitors. IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha directly reduced the expression of insulin degrading enzyme and chaperone molecules (heat shock protein 70 and heat shock cognate protein 70), which are involved in refolding of aggregated proteins. Coculture of MDM with activated, but not naive T cells, suppressed Abeta degradation in MDM, which was partially blocked by a combination of neutralizing Abs against proinflammatory cytokines.

RESULTS: Using the HEK293 expression system, DBL1-X, DBL4-epsilon and DBL6-epsilon were produced at relatively high levels in the culture supernatant, while DBL3-X and DBL5-epsilon were produced at much lower levels. DBL2-X and DBL3-X domains were obtained after refolding of the inclusion bodies produced in E. coli. Importantly, mice antisera raised against the recombinant DBL6-epsilon domain, specifically reacted against the surface of CSA-binding parasites and revealed adhesion blocking activity. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report showing inhibitory binding antibodies obtained through a var2CSA recombinant DBL domain immunization protocol. These results support the current strategies using var2CSA as immunogen in the aim of blocking placental sequestration of malaria parasites. This work is a step towards the development of a var2CSA based vaccine that will prevent pregnancy-associated malaria and improve pregnancy outcomes.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18771584 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Fernandez P, Viebig NK, Dechavanne S, Lepolard C, Gysin J, Scherf A, Gamain B</author>\n    <category>Malar J</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18771584</guid>\n</item>	1	1223446489

We have used rapid-mixing quench-flow methods to extend the time resolution of folding studies on apomyoglobin and elucidate the structural and dynamic features of members of the ensemble of intermediate states that are populated on a submillisecond time scale during this process. The picture that emerges is of a continuum of rapidly interconverting states. Even after only 0.4 ms of refolding time a compact state is formed that contains major parts of the A, G, and H helices, which are sufficiently well folded to protect amides from exchange. The B, C, and E helix regions fold more slowly and fluctuate rapidly between open and closed states as they search docking sites on this core; the secondary structure in these regions becomes stabilized as the refolding time is increased from 0.4 to 6 ms. No further stabilization occurs in the A, G, H core at 6 ms of folding time. These studies begin to time-resolve a progression of compact states between the fully unfolded and native folded states and confirm the presence an ensemble of intermediates that interconvert in a hierarchical sequence as the protein searches conformational space on its folding trajectory.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18779573 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Uzawa T, Nishimura C, Akiyama S, Ishimori K, Takahashi S, Dyson HJ, Wright PE</author>\n    <category>Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18779573</guid>\n</item>	4	1223543606

In this study we explored the mechanism of high-pressure protein refolding by quantitatively assessing the magnitude of the protein-protein interactions both at atmospheric and elevated pressures for T4 lysozyme, in solutions containing various amounts of guanidinium hydrochloride. At atmospheric pressure, the protein- protein interactions are most attractive at moderate guanidinium hydrochloride concentrations ( approximately 1-2 molar), as indicated by a minimum in B(22) values. In contrast, at a pressure of 1,000 bar no minimum in B(22) values is observed, indicating that high pressures colloidally stabilize protein against aggregation. Finally, experimental values of refractive index increments as a function of pressure indicate that at high pressures, wetting of the hydrophobic surfaces is favored, resulting in a reduction of the hydrophobic effect. This reduction in the hydrophobic effect reduces the driving force for aggregation of (partially) unfolded protein. Biotechnol. Bioeng.

Upon receptor activation by blue light, PYP proceeds through a photocycle that includes a partially folded signaling state. The last-step photocycle is a thermal recovery reaction from the signaling state to the native state. Bi-exponential kinetics had been observed for the last-step photocycle, however the slow phase of the bi-exponential kinetics has not been extensively studied. Here we analyzed both fast and slow phase of the last-step photocycle in PYP. From the analysis of the denaturant dependence of the fast and slow phase, we found that the last-step photocycle proceeds through parallel channels of the folding pathway. The burial of solvent accessible area was responsible for the transition state of the fast phase, while structural rearrangement from the compact state to the native state was responsible for the transition state of the slow phase. The photocycle of PYP was linked to the thermodynamic cycle that includes both unfolding and refolding of the fast- and slow-phase intermediates. In order to test the hypothesis of proline-limited folding for the slow phase, we constructed two proline mutants P54A and P68A. We found that only a single phase of the last-step photocycle was observed in P54A. This suggests that there is a low energy barrier between trans to cis conformation in P54 in the light-induced state of PYP, and the resulting cis conformation of P54 generates a slow-phase kinetic trap during the photocycle-coupled folding pathway of PYP.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18794212 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Lee BC, Hoff WD</author>\n    <category>Protein Sci</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18794212</guid>\n</item>	3	1224654892

Our data indicate that the folding/unfolding routes are geometrically frustrated. Follow-up theoretical studies predicted backtracking events that could contribute to the broad transition barrier and the experimentally observed long-lived intermediate. The backtracking route is attributed to the topological frustration introduced by the packing of the functional loop (the beta-bulge, residues 47-53) to the nascent barrel. We used real-time refolding NMR experiments to test for the presence of backtracking events predicted from our theoretical studies. Structural variants of IL-1beta, a beta-bulge deletion, and a circular permutation that opens the protein in the middle of the experimentally observed kinetic intermediate, were also refolded and studied to determine the affects on the observed folding reactions. The functional loop deletion variant demonstrated less backtracking than in WT protein whereas the permutation still maintains backtracking in agreement with theoretical predictions. Taken together, these findings indicate that the backtracking results from geometric frustration introduced into the fold for functional purposes.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18806223 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Capraro DT, Roy M, Onuchic JN, Jennings PA</author>\n    <category>Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18806223</guid>\n</item>	0	1225282420

Numerous studies have demonstrated IL-7's effect on B- and T-cell development as well as its potential in various clinical applications. Previously, a study reported that IL-7 could be purified from inclusion bodies using a prokaryotic system, however, the required refolding step limits the recovery rate. This study was designed to produce a bioactive recombinant human IL-7 (rhIL-7) in a eukaryotic expression system in order to obtain higher yields of the protein with simpler purification steps. We cloned human IL-7 cDNA and successfully expressed active recombinant protein in yeast using the Pichia pastoris expression system. A simple purification strategy was established to purify the rhIL-7 from the fermentation supernatant, yielding 35mg/L at 95% purity by the use of a common SP Sepharose FF cation-exchange chromatography. Functional analysis of the purified rhIL-7 by the pre-B cell MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) proliferation assay demonstrated a specific activity comparable to commercial sources. These results suggest that purification of rhIL-7 from yeast provides a sound strategy for large-scale production of the rhIL-7 for clinical applications as well as basic researches.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18805490 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Luo Y, Kong X, Xu A, Jin S, Wu D</author>\n    <category>Protein Expr Purif</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18805490</guid>\n</item>	43	1225433664

In this research, we investigated the role of the conserved C254 in the refolding of creatine kinase (CK), a key cytosolic enzyme involved in intracellular energetics. It was found that the conserved C254 did not contribute to the activity, structure, stability and unfolding of CK, but played a crucial role in CK refolding under non-reduced conditions by preventing off-pathway aggregation. This property of C254 might be a result of natural selection of CK to fight against oxidative stresses that are frequently encountered by vertebrate cells. The results herein not only confirmed that the reduced condition is important to the activity, structural stability and folding of cytosolic proteins, but also highlighted that it is also crucial for cytosolic proteins to maintain the ability to fold correctly under non-reduced conditions.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18809515 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Liu YM, Feng S, Zhao TJ, Ding XL, Yan YB</author>\n    <category>Biochim Biophys Acta</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18809515</guid>\n</item>	271	1225433664

The affinity matrix for purifying MBP-passenger proteins utilizes amylose covalently attached to magnetic beads, agarose, or a chemically inert fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) matrix--exploiting the natural affinity of MBP for alpha-(1--&gt;4)-maltodextrins in the stationary phase. A fundamental problem is the expression and purification failure of as much as 30% of all constructs, which is limiting for one of the best solubilizing carrier proteins available for recombinant expression. In this chapter, we have discussed aspects of MBP biology that can impact upon binding to the amylose affinity matrix including cloning considerations, structural complications, hydrophobic buffer additives and the presence of cellular biomolecules that bind or modify the matrix during purification. Chromatography conditions are presented for purification at very small scales of less than 0.5 mL using amylose magnetic beads, a batch and semi-batch method for small to moderate scale purifications up to approximately 35 mg and larger scale FPLC methods. A novel matrix-assisted dialysis refolding method is also described whereby MBP-passenger proteins can be refolded in the presence of amylose matrix in instances where native purification methods fail to bind the amylose matrix.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18826055 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Pattenden LK, Thomas WG</author>\n    <category>Methods Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18826055</guid>\n</item>	6	1225792084

This uniquely reactive C-terminus can be used in native chemical ligation reactions to introduce synthetic groups or to immobilize proteins on surfaces and nanoparticles. Unfortunately, common refolding procedures for recombinant proteins that contain disulfide bonds do not preserve the thioester functionality and therefore novel refolding procedures need to be developed. RESULTS: A novel redox buffer consisting of MESNA and diMESNA showed a refolding efficiency comparable to that of GSH/GSSG and prevented loss of the protein's thioester functionality. Moreover, introduction of the MESNA/diMESNA redox couple in the cleavage buffer allowed simultaneous on-column refolding of Ribonuclease A and intein-mediated cleavage to yield Ribonuclease A with a C-terminal MESNA-thioester. The C-terminal thioester was shown to be active in native chemical ligation. CONCLUSIONS: An efficient method was developed for the production of disulfide bond containing proteins with C-terminal thioesters. Introduction of a MESNA/diMESNA redox couple resulted in simultaneous on-column refolding, purification and thioester generation of the model protein Ribonuclease A.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18828922 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Bastings MM, van Baal I, Meijer EW, Merkx M</author>\n    <category>BMC Biotechnol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18828922</guid>\n</item>	4	1225792084

Thus, understanding the biochemical function of prostasin and developing specific agents to inhibit its activity could have a significant impact on a widespread disease. We report the expression of the prostasin proenzyme in E. coli as insoluble inclusion bodies, refolding, and activation via proteolytic removal of the N-terminal propeptide. The refolded and activated enzyme was shown to be pure and monomeric, with kinetic characteristics very similar to prostasin expressed from eukaryotic systems. Active prostasin was crystallized and the structure determined to 1.45A resolution. These apo-protein crystals were soaked with nafamostat, allowing the structure of the inhibited acyl-enzyme intermediate structure to be determined to 2.0A resolution.

This work investigates how QSOX and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) cooperate in vitro to generate native pairings in two unfolded reduced proteins: ribonuclease A (RNase, four disulfide bonds and 105 disulfide isomers of the fully oxidized protein) and avian riboflavin binding protein (RfBP, nine disulfide bonds and more than 34 million corresponding disulfide pairings). Experiments combining avian or human QSOX with up to 200 muM avian or human reduced PDI show that the isomerase is not a significant substrate of QSOX. Both reduced RNase and RfBP can be efficiently refolded in an aerobic solution containing micromolar concentrations of reduced PDI and nanomolar levels of QSOX without any added oxidized PDI or glutathione redox buffer. Refolding of RfBP is followed continuously using the complete quenching of the fluorescence of free riboflavin that occurs on binding to apo-RfBP. The rate of refolding is half-maximal at 30 muM reduced PDI when the reduced client protein (1 muM) is used in the presence of 30 nM QSOX. The use of high concentrations of PDI, in considerable excess over the folding protein client, reflects the concentration prevailing in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and allows the redox poise of these in vitro experiments to be set with oxidized and reduced PDI. In the absence of either QSOX or redox buffer, the fastest refolding of RfBP is accomplished with excess reduced PDI and just enough oxidized PDI to generate nine disulfides in the protein client. These in vitro experiments are discussed in terms of current models for oxidative folding in the endoplasmic reticulum.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18937500 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Rancy PC, Thorpe C</author>\n    <category>Biochemistry</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18937500</guid>\n</item>	8	1224681137

While the structure of PrP(Sc) remains enigmatic, recent studies have afforded increasingly detailed characterization of recombinant PrP amyloid. However, all previous studies were performed using amyloid fibrils formed in the presence of denaturing agents that significantly alter the folding state(s) of the precursor monomer. Here we report that PrP amyloid can also be generated under physiologically relevant conditions, where the monomeric protein is natively folded. Remarkably, site-directed spin labeling studies reveal that these fibrils posses a beta-core structure nearly indistinguishable from that of amyloid grown under denaturing conditions, where the C-terminal alpha-helical domain of the PrP monomer undergoes major refolding to a parallel and in-register beta-structure upon conversion. The structural similarity of fibrils formed under drastically different conditions strongly suggests that the common beta-sheet architecture within the ~160-220 core region represents a distinct global minimum in the PrP conversion free energy landscape. We also show that the N-terminal region of fibrillar PrP displays conformational plasticity, undergoing a reversible structural transition with an apparent pKa of ~5.3. The C-terminal region, on the other hand, retains its beta-structure over the pH range 1-11, whereas more alkaline buffer conditions denature the fibrils into constituent PrP monomers. This profile of pH-dependent stability is reminiscent of the behavior of brain-derived PrP(Sc), suggesting a substantial degree of structural similarity within the beta-core region of these PrP aggregates.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18930924 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Cobb NJ, Apetri AC, Surewicz WK</author>\n    <category>J Biol Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18930924</guid>\n</item>	58	1226390658

Increasing therapeutic applications for recombinant human extracellular superoxide dismutase (rEC-SOD) has broadened interest in optimizing methods for its purification, with a native conformation of tetramer. We describe a solid phase refolding procedure that combines immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and gel filtration chromatography in the purification of rEC-SOD from Escherichia coli. The purified rEC-SOD tetramer from the Ni2+-column chromatography is refolded in Tris buffer. This method yields greater than 90% of the tetramer form. Greater than 99% purity is achieved with further purification over a Superose 12PC 3.2/30 column to obtain the tetramer and specific activities as determined via DCFHDA assay.

Due to its toxicity, it is essential to monitor the clearance of DTT throughout the analytical flow from the refolding phase to the final formulated product. Here we report a direct, simple, and fast liquid chromatography method using UV and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) detection for DTT evaluation in complex protein mixtures. In aqueous solution DTT exists as an equilibrium mixture of the oxidized and the reduced form (H(2)DTT --&gt; DTT(ox)) and the quantitation tools should therefore be applicable to both forms in a single step or in multiple steps. Oxidation of DTT with aqueous copper(II) nitrate trihydrate solution was introduced to determine a single oxidized compound, i. e. DTT(ox). Proteins and other components of high molecular masses were separated from DTT(ox) by ultrafiltration. Consequently, efficient separation of the DTT(ox )from other flow-through mixture components (sugars, polymers, salts, protein stabilizers) was achieved on an Atlantis dC(18) column. After chromatographic separation, DTT(ox) was selectively identified by UV absorbance at 285 nm or by selected reaction monitoring, measuring signal transition between m/z 151 --&gt; 105.

To elucidate the mechanism involved in NS2B-mediated activation of NS3 protease, molecular dynamic simulation, principal-component analysis, molecular docking, mutagenesis and bioassay studies were carried out on both dengue NS3pro and NS2B-NS3pro systems. The results revealed the NS2B-NS3pro complex is more rigid than NS3pro alone due to its robust hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interaction networks within the complex. These potent networks lead to remodeling of the secondary and tertiary structures of the protease that facilitates cleavage sequence recognition and binding of substrates.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis MfpA is a founding member of the Pentapeptide Repeat Protein (PRP) family that confers resistance to the antibiotic fluoroquinolone by binding to DNA gyrase and inhibiting its activity. MfpA's size, shape and surface potential mimics duplex DNA. As an initial step in a comprehensive biophysi-cal analysis of the role of PRPs in the regulation of cellular topoisomerase activity and confer-ring antibiotic resistance, we have explored the solution structure and refolding of MfpA by fluo-rescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD) and analytical centrifugation. A unique CD spec-trum for the pentapeptide repeat fold is described. This spectrum reveals a native structure whose ss-strands and turns within the right-handed quadrilateral ss-helix that define the PRP fold differ from canonical secondary structure types. MfpA refolded from urea or guanidium by dialysis or dilution forms stable aggregates of monomers whose secondary and tertiary structure are not na-tive. In contrast, MfpA refolded using a novel 'time-dependent renaturation' protocol yields pro-tein with native secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure. The generality of 'time-dependent renaturation' to other proteins and denaturation methods is discussed.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18977756 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Khrapunov S, Cheng H, Hegde S, Blanchard J, Brenowitz M</author>\n    <category>J Biol Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18977756</guid>\n</item>	2	1226664270

However, no PDE8 selective inhibitors are available for trial treatment of human diseases. Here we report kinetic properties of the highly active PDE8A1 catalytic domain prepared from refolding and its crystal structures in the unliganded and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) bound forms at 1.9 and 2.1 A resolutions, respectively. The PDE8A1 catalytic domain has a K M of 1.8 muM, V max of 6.1 mumol/min/mg, a k cat of 4.0 s (-1) for cAMP, and a K M of 1.6 mM, V max of 2.5 mumol/min/mg, a k cat of 1.6 s (-1) for cGMP, thus indicating that the substrate specificity of PDE8 is dominated by K M. The structure of the PDE8A1 catalytic domain has similar topology as those of other PDE families but contains two extra helices around Asn685-Thr710. Since this fragment is distant from the active site of the enzyme, its impact on the catalysis is unclear. The PDE8A1 catalytic domain is insensitive to the IBMX inhibition (IC 50 = 700 muM). The unfavorable interaction of IBMX in the PDE8A1-IBMX structure suggests an important role of Tyr748 in the inhibitor binding. Indeed, the mutation of Tyr748 to phenylalanine increases the PDE8A1 sensitivity to several nonselective or family selective PDE inhibitors. Thus, the structural and mutagenesis studies provide not only insight into the enzymatic properties but also guidelines for design of PDE8 selective inhibitors.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18983167 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Wang H, Yan Z, Yang S, Cai J, Robinson H, Ke H</author>\n    <category>Biochemistry</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18983167</guid>\n</item>	22	1226069509

However, no PDE8 selective inhibitors are available for trial treatment of human diseases. Here we report kinetic properties of the highly active PDE8A1 catalytic domain prepared from refolding and its crystal structures in the unliganded and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) bound forms at 1.9 and 2.1 A resolutions, respectively. The PDE8A1 catalytic domain has a K M of 1.8 muM, V max of 6.1 mumol/min/mg, a k cat of 4.0 s (-1) for cAMP, and a K M of 1.6 mM, V max of 2.5 mumol/min/mg, a k cat of 1.6 s (-1) for cGMP, thus indicating that the substrate specificity of PDE8 is dominated by K M. The structure of the PDE8A1 catalytic domain has similar topology as those of other PDE families but contains two extra helices around Asn685-Thr710. Since this fragment is distant from the active site of the enzyme, its impact on the catalysis is unclear. The PDE8A1 catalytic domain is insensitive to the IBMX inhibition (IC 50 = 700 muM). The unfavorable interaction of IBMX in the PDE8A1-IBMX structure suggests an important role of Tyr748 in the inhibitor binding. Indeed, the mutation of Tyr748 to phenylalanine increases the PDE8A1 sensitivity to several nonselective or family selective PDE inhibitors. Thus, the structural and mutagenesis studies provide not only insight into the enzymatic properties but also guidelines for design of PDE8 selective inhibitors.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18983167 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Wang H, Yan Z, Yang S, Cai J, Robinson H, Ke H</author>\n    <category>Biochemistry</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18983167</guid>\n</item>	22	1227707806

Many proteins in tumor cells are dependent upon the Hsp90 protein folding machinery for their stability, refolding, and maturation. Inhibition of Hsp90 uniquely targets client proteins associated with all six hallmarks of cancer. Thus, Hsp90 has emerged as a promising target for the treatment of cancer. Hsp90 exists as a homodimer, which contains three domains. The N-terminal domain contains an ATP-binding site that binds the natural products geldanamycin and radicicol. The middle domain is highly charged and has high affinity for co-chaperones and client proteins. Initial studies by Csermely and co-workers suggested a second ATP-binding site in the C-terminus of Hsp90. This C-terminal nucleotide binding pocket has been shown to not only bind ATP, but cisplatin, novobiocin, epilgallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and taxol. The coumarin antibiotics novobiocin, clorobiocin, and coumermycin A1 were isolated from several streptomyces strains and exhibit potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria. These compounds bind type II topoisomerases, including DNA gyrase, and inhibit the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of ATP. As a result, novobiocin analogues have garnered the attention of numerous researchers as an attractive agent for the treatment of bacterial infection. Novobiocin was reported to bind weakly to the newly discovered Hsp90 C-terminal ATP binding site ( approximately 700 M in SkBr3 cells) and induce degradation of Hsp90 client proteins. Structural modification of this compound has led to an increase of 1000-fold in activity in anti-proliferative assays. Recent studies of structure-activity relationship (SAR) by Renoir and co-workers highlighted the crucial role of the C-4 and/or C-7 positions of the coumarin and removal of the noviose moiety, which appeared to be essential for degradation of Hsp90 client proteins. Unlike the N-terminal ATP binding site, there is no reported co-crystal structure of Hsp90 C-terminus bound to any inhibitor. The Hsp90 C-terminal domain, however, is known to contain a conserved pentapeptide sequence (MEEVD) which is recognized by co-chaperones. Cisplatin is a platinum-containing chemotherapeutic used to treat various types of cancers, including testicular, ovarian, bladder, and small cell lung cancer. Most notably, cisplatin coordinates to DNA bases, resulting in cross-linked DNA, which prohibits rapidly dividing cells from duplicating DNA for mitosis. Itoh and co-workers reported that cisplatin decreases the chaperone activity of Hsp90. This group applied bovine brain cytosol to a cisplatin affinity column, eluted with cisplatin and detected Hsp90 in the eluent. Subsequent experiments indicated that cisplatin exhibits high affinity for Hsp90. Moreover Csermely and co-workers determined that the cisplatin binding site is located proximal to the C-terminal ATP binding site. EGCG is one of the active ingredients found in green tea. EGCG is known to inhibit the activity of many Hsp90-dependent client proteins, including telomerase, several kinases, and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Recently Gasiewicz and co-workers reported that EGCG manifests its antagonistic activity against AhR through binding Hsp90. Similar to novobiocin, EGCG was shown to bind the C-terminus of Hsp90. Unlike previously identified N-terminal Hsp90 inhibitors, EGCG does not appear to prevent Hsp90 from forming multiprotein complexes. Studies are currently underway to determine whether EGCG competes with novobiocin or cisplatin binding. Taxol, a well-known drug for the treatment of cancer, is responsible for the stabilization of microtubules and the inhibition of mitosis. Previous studies have shown that taxol induces the activation of kinases and transcription factors, and mimics the effect of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an attribute unrelated to its tubulin-binding properties. Rosen and co-workers prepared a biotinylated taxol derivative and performed affinity chromatography experiments with lysates from both mouse brain and macrophage cell lines. These studies led to identification of two chaperones, Hsp70 and Hsp90, by mass spectrometry. In contrast to typical Hsp90-binding drugs, taxol exhibits a stimulatory response. Recently it was reported that the geldanamycin derivative 17-AAG behaves synergistically with taxol-induced apoptosis. This review describes the different C-terminal inhibitors of Hsp90, with specific emphasis on structure-activity relationship studies of novobiocin and their effects on anti-proliferative activity.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18991631 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Donnelly A, Blagg BS</author>\n    <category>Curr Med Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18991631</guid>\n</item>	4	1227768319

The equilibrium unfolding/refolding of Ssh10b induced by denaturants and heat was fully reversible, suggesting that Ssh10b could serve as a good model for folding/unfolding studies of protein dimers. Here, we investigate the folding/unfolding kinetics of Ssh10b in detail by stopped-flow circular dichroism (SF-CD) and using GdnHCl as denaturant. In unfolding reactions, the native Ssh10b turned rapidly into fully unfolded monomers within the stopped-flow dead time with no detectable kinetic intermediate, agreeing well with the results of equilibrium unfolding experiments. In refolding reactions, two unfolded monomers associate in the burst phase to form a dimeric intermediate that undergoes a further, slower, first-order folding process to form the native dimer.

Since the therapeutic allergens currently used are naturally extracted, producing preparations with a stable titer from such extracts is extremely difficult. There are several reports on the expression of recombinant mite allergens in Escherichia coli using inducers. The use of an inducer for industrial production will lead to high costs and, for therapeutic use, it must be removed in the purification process. C8/119S is a mutant of Der f 2, a major house dust mite allergen. The C8/119S gene was integrated downstream of the trp promoter to produce the expression plasmid (pWU11-C8/119S). Then, this expression plasmid was used to transform E. coli strain HB101 (pWU11-C8/119S/HB101). A recombinant E. coli pWU11-C8/119S/HB101 did not express C8/119S in a low-temperature culture (32 degrees C), but C8/119S was induced to a high level of expression in a high-temperature culture (37 degrees C). pWU11-C8/119S/HB101 proliferated when expression was induced by high temperature and an approximately 3-fold greater proliferation was obtained compared with the use of an inducer in a large-scale culture. The C8/119S protein was expressed as inclusion bodies and obtained by refolding and chromatography purifications. The immunological properties of C8/119S were assessed by western blotting. Western blotting demonstrated that purified C8/119S reacted with a monoclonal anti-Der f 2 antibody (18G8). pWU11-C8/119S/HB101 can be used as an easy, low cost expression system on a large scale. It is also advantageous for industrial production in that the addition of an inducer is not required to achieve expression of the mite allergen.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19000616 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Koyanagi S, Maeda T, Murakami T, Kawatsu K, Sugawara K, Miyatsu Y, Mizokami H</author>\n    <category>J Biosci Bioeng</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19000616</guid>\n</item>	27	1228815611

For a homologous series of compounds, a direct correlation was established between the absolute screw sense, either ( P)- or ( M)-, of this helical folding and the absolute configuration, either ( R)- or ( S)-, of the chiral alcohol groups introducing local asymmetric bias to the conformationally restricted molecular backbone. (1)H NMR and CD spectroscopic studies provided significant insights into structural folding and unfolding of these chiral molecules in solution, which proceed via reversible assembly and disassembly of the C 3-symmetric hydrogen-bonding network. Notably, solvents profoundly influenced this dynamic process. A strong correlation between the solvent donor number (DN) or solvent basicity (SB) parameters and the change in the Cotton effects pointed toward specific O-H...solvent interactions that drive structural unfolding and eventual refolding to apparently opposite helicity. This unusual chirality inversion process could also be induced by installation of chemical protecting groups that simulate specific solvent-solute interactions. Removal of this covalent mimic of the solvent shell restored the original screw sense of the parent molecule, thus establishing the feasibility of covalently triggered helicity inversion as a new mode of operation for chiroptical molecular switches.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 18998685 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Jiang X, Lim YK, Zhang BJ, Opsitnick EA, Baik MH, Lee D</author>\n    <category>J Am Chem Soc</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:18998685</guid>\n</item>	0	1228815611

A fundamental question in this regard is the role of the amino acid sequence of the protein. In this context, we have investigated here the equilibrium refolding to a partially folded state of the GTPase effector domain (GED) of dynamin driven by addition of increasing amounts of trifluoroethanol (TFE) and compared it with that driven by progressive dilution of the guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn-HCl) denaturant, which has been reported recently [ Chugh et al. ( 2008) Protein Science 17, 1319- 1325 ]. The structural and dynamics changes as the molecule refolds starting from the Gdn-HCl denatured state have been monitored by circular dichroism, fluorescence, and NMR. The molecule remains a monomer in the TFE limiting case, whereas in the Gdn-HCl case, the molecule self-associates as the denaturant is removed. Even so, the two equilibrium transitions seem to have many similarities. The limiting helical contents are similar, and the regions of progressive increase in millisecond time scale motions, suggestive of slow conformational transitions, are largely the same. Though in the guanidine dilution case the partially folded molecules self-associate and there is multimer-monomer equilibrium, the very high concentration ( approximately 6 M) of guanidine prevents self-association in the case of TFE created species. Taken together, the observations under the drastically different solvation conditions suggest that the GED sequence is designed to self-assemble via helices leading to formation of a fully folded megadalton size assembly. The present observations may also have implications for the folding and association mechanism of the protein. These are important from the point of view of dynamin function.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19006333 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Chugh J, Sharma S, Hosur RV</author>\n    <category>Biochemistry</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19006333</guid>\n</item>	1	1229505007

Although DM has been shown to have two activities, peptide release and MHC class II refolding, a clear characterization of the mechanism by which DM facilitates peptide exchange has remained elusive. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have previously demonstrated that peptide binding to and dissociation from MHCII in the absence of DM are cooperative processes, likely related to conformational changes in the peptide-MHCII complex. Here we show that DM promotes peptide release by a non-cooperative process, whereas it enhances cooperative folding of the exchange peptide. Through electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and fluorescence polarization (FP) we show that DM releases prebound peptide very poorly in the absence of a candidate peptide for the exchange process. The affinity and concentration of the candidate peptide are also important for the release of the prebound peptide. Increased fluorescence energy transfer between the prebound and exchange peptides in the presence of DM is evidence for a tetramolecular complex which resolves in favor of the peptide that has superior folding properties. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This study shows that both the peptide releasing activity on loaded MHCII and the facilitating of MHCII binding by a candidate exchange peptide are integral to DM mediated epitope selection. The exchange process is initiated only in the presence of candidate peptides, avoiding possible release of a prebound peptide and loss of a potential epitope. In a tetramolecular transitional complex, the candidate peptides are checked for their ability to replace the pre-bound peptide with a geometry that allows the rebinding of the original peptide. Thus, DM promotes a "compare-exchange" sorting algorithm on an available peptide pool. Such a "third party"-mediated mechanism may be generally applicable for diverse ligand recognition in other biological systems.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19005572 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Ferrante A, Anderson MW, Klug CS, Gorski J</author>\n    <category>PLoS ONE</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19005572</guid>\n</item>	7	1229505007

Since Hsp70 participates in recovery from stress injury, we examined the effect of Hsp70 genetic deletion in the azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium (AOM/DSS) model of inflammation and colon cancer. Methods: Hsp70 mutant mice (Hsp70.1(-/-)/70.3(-/-)) and wild type (WT) littermates received AOM and 3 cycles of DSS and were sacrificed 24 wks later. Tumors were graded for histology and immunostained for p53, APC, beta-catenin, Cox-2 and iNOS and sequenced for p53 mutations. Results: Elevated adenomas developed in 4/10 WT mice with no dysplasia in adjacent mucosa. In contrast, 7/8 Hsp70 KO mice developed chronic mucosal inflammation and multifocal areas of flat dysplasia and 4/8 progressed to invasive carcinomas arising in a background of flat dysplastic mucosa. These differences in the incidence of flat dysplasia and invasive cancers were significant (p&lt;0.05). Nuclear p53 was stronger in Hsp70 KO tumors compared to WT tumors, and sequencing confirmed p53 mutations in 2/5 tumors from Hsp70(-/-) vs. 0/5 in WT mice. In Hsp70 WT tumors beta-catenin was predominantly nuclear, compared with membranous beta-catenin in Hsp70(-/-) tumors, suggesting that Hsp70 regulates beta-catenin in colonic tumorigenesis. Cox-2 and iNOS levels were increased in tumors from Hsp70(-/-) mice compared to Hsp70 wild type tumors. Conclusions: Hsp70-deleted mice treated with AOM/DSS develop flat invasive colonic tumors that mimic many histological and molecular features of UC colon cancer. This model will be useful to dissect the role of Hsp70 in IBD colon cancer.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19005184 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Tao Y, Hart J, Lichtenstein L, Joseph L, Ciancio M, Hu S, Chang EB, Bissonnette M</author>\n    <category>Carcinogenesis</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19005184</guid>\n</item>	12	1229505007

However, the traditional dilution or column refolding strategy, based on gradual denaturant removal, is found to be inefficient for the recovery of protein activity. In this study, a new refolding strategy harnessing the ClpB and DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE bichaperone system is demonstrated to be superior to the conventional refolding methods in either batch dilution or column refolding mode. It is noted that the efficacy of bichaperone-mediated column refolding strategy is further highlighted especially when refolding reaction is attempted at a higher protein concentration with the recirculation of the refolding cocktail containing the bichaperone system. This is evidenced by an uncompromised refolding efficiency (ca. 21.4%) achieved at 2000mug/mL of initial protein concentration, which is comparable to the refolding efficiency (ca. 22.5%) obtained at 20 times lower protein concentration (i.e. 100mug/mL) in the conventional batch dilution refolding technique.

In vitro, SecB binds to a variety of unfolded substrates-but not native proteins-without apparent sequence specificity. Selectivity has therefore been suggested to occur by kinetic partitioning of substrates between protein folding and SecB association. Evidence for kinetic partitioning is based on earlier observations that SecB blocks the refolding of the precursor form of maltose-binding protein (preMBP)(5) and slow-folding maltose-binding protein (MBP) mutants, but not faster-folding mature wild-type MBP. In order to quantitatively validate the kinetic partitioning model, we have independently measured each of the rate constants involved in the interaction of SecB with refolding preMBP (a physiological substrate of SecB) and mature MBP. The measured rate constants correctly predict substrate folding kinetics over a wide range of SecB, MBP, and preMBP concentrations. Analysis of the data reveals that, for many substrates, kinetic partitioning is unlikely to be responsible for SecB-mediated protein export. Instead, the ability of SecB-bound substrates to continue folding while bound to SecB and their ability to interact with other components of the secretory machinery such as SecA may be key opposing determinants that inhibit and promote protein export, respectively.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19028503 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Krishnan B, Kulothungan SR, Patra AK, Udgaonkar JB, Varadarajan R</author>\n    <category>J Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19028503</guid>\n</item>	7	1227768319

Using truncated forms of E1, we reconstituted a low-pH-dependent intermediate composed of trimers of DI/II. Unexpectedly, DI/II trimers were stable in the absence of DIII. Once formed at a low pH, DI/II trimers efficiently and specifically bound recombinant DIII through a pH-independent reaction. Even in the absence of DIII, DI/II trimers interacted to form hexagonal lattices and to cause membrane deformation and tubulation. These studies identify a prefusion intermediate in class II membrane fusion.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19064260 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> SÃ¡nchez-San MartÃ­n C, Sosa H, Kielian M</author>\n    <category>Cell Host Microbe</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19064260</guid>\n</item>	119	1232017923

Understanding the molecular details of this process is essential for antiviral strategies. Recent structural studies revealed a stunning diversity of viral fusion proteins in their native state. In spite of this diversity, the post-fusion structures of these proteins share a common trimeric hairpin motif in which the amino- and carboxy-terminal hydrophobic domains are positioned at the same end of a rod-shaped molecule. The converging hairpin motif, along with biochemical and functional data, implies that disparate viral proteins promote membrane merger via a universal "cast-and-fold" mechanism. According to this model, fusion proteins first anchor themselves to the target membrane through their hydrophobic segments and then fold back, bringing the viral and cellular membranes together and forcing their merger. However, the pathways of protein refolding and the mechanism by which this refolding is coupled to membrane rearrangements are still not understood. The availability of specific inhibitors targeting distinct steps of HIV-1 entry permitted the identification of key conformational states of its envelope glycoprotein en route to fusion. These studies provided functional evidence for the direct engagement of the target membrane by HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein prior to fusion and revealed the role of partially folded pre-hairpin conformations in promoting the pore formation.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19077194 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Melikyan GB</author>\n    <category>Retrovirology</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19077194</guid>\n</item>	2	1229522659

CA9 is expressed in nearly all clear-cell renal tumors; levels of CA9 expression predict prognosis and response to interleukin-2 therapy. These observations may be explained by a novel chaperone-like function of CA9, which allows it to serve as an immunoadjuvant and stimulate an adaptive immune response against tumor antigens. Classic heat shock proteins (HSP) such as HSP110 and HSP70 are up-regulated in response to cellular stress and function to protect intracellular proteins from aggregation. Similarly, CA9 formed complexes with client proteins and inhibited heat-induced aggregation and enabled refolding of denatured client protein. HSP released from injured cells activate an immune response. CA9 bound dendritic cells in a receptor-specific manner. Bound CA9 was internalized by dendritic cells and processed primarily through the proteosomal pathway. In a murine melanoma model, a complex of CA9 and gp100 generated a gp100-specific antitumor response. A soluble form of CA9 shed from tumor cells had the same chaperone-like functions, providing renal tumors and hypoxic cells with a mechanism for stimulating an immune response against extracellular antigens. Interleukin-2 treatment of patient renal tumors in short-term culture increased CA9 shedding, suggesting a strategy for augmenting the immunogenicity of renal tumors. CA9 has chaperone-like functions and CA9 shed from tumors may play a direct role in stimulating an adaptive immune response.

CA9 is expressed in nearly all clear-cell renal tumors; levels of CA9 expression predict prognosis and response to interleukin-2 therapy. These observations may be explained by a novel chaperone-like function of CA9, which allows it to serve as an immunoadjuvant and stimulate an adaptive immune response against tumor antigens. Classic heat shock proteins (HSP) such as HSP110 and HSP70 are up-regulated in response to cellular stress and function to protect intracellular proteins from aggregation. Similarly, CA9 formed complexes with client proteins and inhibited heat-induced aggregation and enabled refolding of denatured client protein. HSP released from injured cells activate an immune response. CA9 bound dendritic cells in a receptor-specific manner. Bound CA9 was internalized by dendritic cells and processed primarily through the proteosomal pathway. In a murine melanoma model, a complex of CA9 and gp100 generated a gp100-specific antitumor response. A soluble form of CA9 shed from tumor cells had the same chaperone-like functions, providing renal tumors and hypoxic cells with a mechanism for stimulating an immune response against extracellular antigens. Interleukin-2 treatment of patient renal tumors in short-term culture increased CA9 shedding, suggesting a strategy for augmenting the immunogenicity of renal tumors. CA9 has chaperone-like functions and CA9 shed from tumors may play a direct role in stimulating an adaptive immune response.

Pulling sites located on the terminal nucleobases lead to a force-extension curve with two peaks and the unfolding is more cooperative. Simulations of the refolding of partially unfolded quadruplexes show very different behavior for the two different pulling modalities. In particular, starting from an unfolded state prepared by nucleobase pulling leads to a long-lived intermediate state whose existence is also corroborated by the free energy profile computed with the Jarzinsky equation.

One sdAb pair in particular was found to be highly specific for ricin. While polyclonal antibodies cross react strongly with RCA120, the sdAb pair had minimal cross reactivity. In addition, the binders were found to be thermal stable, regaining their ricin binding activity following heating to 85 degrees C for an hour. Cycles of thermally induced unfolding of the sdAb and their subsequent refolding upon cooling was monitored by circular dichroism. As several of the sdAb were observed to bind to ricin's A chain, cell free translation assays were performed to monitor the ability of the sdAbs to inhibit ricin's biological activity. One of the sdAb (C8) was particularly effective and blocked ricin's biological activity with an effectiveness equal to that of a mouse antiricin antibody.

A single active-site mutation of the tryptophan to an alanine in Staphylococcus aureus Trx converts the oxidized protein into a biologically inactive domain-swapped dimer. While the monomeric protein unfolds reversibly in a two-state manner, the oxidized dimeric form is kinetically stable and converts to the monomeric form upon refolding. After reduction, the half-life of the dimer decreases with many orders of magnitude to approximately 4.3 h, indicating that the active-site disulfide between Cys29 and Cys32 is an important determinant for the kinetics of unfolding.

In the current study, the gene encoding the cysteine protease of C. parvum (cryptopain-1) was identified and the biochemical properties of the recombinant enzyme were characterized. Cryptopain-1 shared common structural properties with cathepsin L-like papain family enzymes, but lacked a typical signal peptide sequence and contained a possible transmembrane domain near the amino terminus and a unique insert in the front of the mature domain. The recombinant cryptopain-1 expressed in Escherichia coli and refolded to the active form showed typical biochemical properties of cathepsin L-like enzymes. The folding determinant of cryptopain-1 was characterized through multiple constructs with or without different lengths of the pro-domain of the enzyme expressed in E. coli and assessment of their refolding abilities. All constructs, except one that did not contain the full-length mature domain, successfully refolded into the active enzymes, suggesting that cryptopain-1 did not require the pro-domain for folding. Western blot analysis showed that cryptopain-1 was expressed in the sporozoites and the enzyme preferentially degraded proteins, including collagen and fibronectin, but not globular proteins. This suggested a probable role for cryptopain-1 in host cell invasion and/or egression by the parasite.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19091155 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Na BK, Kang JM, Cheun HI, Cho SH, Moon SU, Kim TS, Sohn WM</author>\n    <category>Parasitology</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19091155</guid>\n</item>	43	1232603631

Here, we investigate the influence of two Escherichia coli sHsps, IbpA and IbpB, on the properties of aggregates formed under heat shock conditions and the susceptibility of these aggregates to chaperone-dependent reactivation. Our results show that the presence of IbpA during heat denaturation is sufficient to change the macroscopic properties of aggregates. The aggregates are substantially smaller than aggregates formed in the absence of sHsps and they are stained differently on electron micrographs. Moreover, these aggregates are indistinguishable, by electron microscopy studies and sedimentation analysis, from aggregates obtained during heat denaturation in the presence of IbpA and IbpB. However, the morphological similarity between these two types of aggregates does not correlate with similar susceptibility to Hsp100-Hsp70-dependent reactivation. The presence of IbpA alone during substrate denaturation does not increase the efficiency of the subsequent Hsp100-Hsp70-dependent reactivation. On the contrary, substantial inhibition of this process is observed. IbpB associates with aggregates at high temperature due to its interaction with IbpA and releases the IbpA-mediated inhibitory effect. Our results suggest there is an interplay between IbpA and IbpB in promoting Hsp100-Hsp70-mediated disaggregation of protein aggregates. Although each seems to play a different role in this process, they cooperate to stabilize protein aggregates in a disaggregation-competent state.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19101567 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Ratajczak E, ZiÄ™tkiewicz S, Liberek K</author>\n    <category>J Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19101567</guid>\n</item>	1	1232701269

The protease and chaperone activities of HtrA eliminate or refold damaged and unfolded proteins in the bacterial periplasm that are generated upon stress conditions. In the absence of substrates, HtrA oligomerizes into a hexameric cage but binding of misfolded proteins transform the hexamers into bigger 12-mer and 24-mer cages that encapsulate the substrates for degradation or refolding. HtrA also undergoes partial degradation as a consequence of self-cleavage of the mature protein producing short-HtrA protein (s-HtrA). The aim of this study is to understand the physiological role of this self-cleavage process. We found that the only requirement for self-cleavage of HtrA into s-HtrA in vitro was the hydrolysis of protein substrates. In fact, peptides resulting from the hydrolysis of the protein substrates were sufficient to induce autocleavage. However, continuous presence of full-length substrate delayed the process. In addition, we observed that the hexameric cage structure is required for autocleavage and that s-HtrA accumulates only late in the degradation reaction. These results suggest that self-cleavage occurs when HtrA reassembles back into the resting hexameric structure and peptides resulting from substrate hydrolysis are allosterically stimulating the HtrA proteolytic activity. Our data support a model in which the physiological role of the self-cleavage process is to eliminate the excess of HtrA once the stress conditions cease.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19103920 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Jomaa A, Iwanczyk J, Tran J, Ortega J</author>\n    <category>J Bacteriol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19103920</guid>\n</item>	1	1232793564

Hsp90 dimerization, which occurs at the C-terminal end, was also inhibited by EGCG treatment. Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that EGCG stabilizes an AhR complex that includes hsp90 and XAP2 (hepatitis B virus X-associated protein 2), and decreases the association of aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator (Arnt) with ligand-activated AhR. Thus, EGCG, through its ability to bind to hsp90, blocks AhR response element (AhRE) recognition.

The current model for the major route of disulphide formation is the regulated flow of oxidizing equivalents from molecular oxygen to the membrane associated enzyme Ero1 to protein disulphide isomerase and hence to substrate proteins. One molecule of hydrogen peroxide is produced by Ero1 per disulphide bond made. This peroxide is usually considered to be a dangerous by-product. Here we show that peroxide, added to a refolding buffer or generated enzymatically in situ results in the efficient refolding of a model protein to the native state. At pH 7.0 the kinetics of obtaining the native folded state are more efficient using peroxide than by the use of a glutathione redox buffer. Disulphide bond formation by peroxide is kinetically favoured over oxidation of cysteine to cysteine sulfinic acid and over the oxidation of other amino acids in the proteins such as methionine. Hence, unless peroxides are added in excess, oxidative damage to the folding protein is minimal. Our results offer insights into potential mechanisms for disulphide bond formation in vivo.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19117384 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Karala AR, Lappi AK, Saaranen M, Ruddock LW</author>\n    <category>Antioxid Redox Signal</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19117384</guid>\n</item>	134	1233064042

Electron micrographs showed that GroEL G192W intrinsically formed an asymmetric double ring structure with one ring locked in the 'open' conformation, and it is postulated that GroES binds to this open ring in the absence of ATP. Trans-binding of both substrate protein and GroES was observed for this binary complex, but simultaneous binding of both substrate and GroES (a mechanism that ensures substrate encapsulation) was impaired. We postulate that alteration of Gly192 severely compromises an essential movement that allows efficient encapsulation of unfolded protein intermediates.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19130907 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Machida K, Fujiwara R, Tanaka T, Sakane I, Hongo K, Mizobata T, Kawata Y</author>\n    <category>Biochim Biophys Acta</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19130907</guid>\n</item>	24	1233640147

Structural studies of GPCRs require that several tedious preliminary steps be fulfilled before setting up the first crystallization experiments: protein expression, detergent solubilization, purification, and stabilization. Here we report on screening expression conditions of approximately 100 GPCRs in Escherichia coli with a view to obtain large amounts of inclusion bodies, a prerequisite to the subsequent refolding step. A set of optimal conditions, including appropriate vectors (Gateway pDEST17oi), strain (C43), and fermentation at high optical density, define the best first instance choice. Beyond this minimal setting, however, the rate of success increases significantly with the number of conditions tested. In contrast with experiments based on a single GPCR expression, our approach provides statistically significant results and indicates that up to 40% of GPCRs can be expressed as inclusion bodies in quantities sufficient for subsequent refolding, solubilization, and purification.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19150325 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Michalke K, GraviÃ¨re ME, Huyghe C, Vincentelli R, Wagner R, Pattus F, Schroeder K, Oschmann J, Rudolph R, Cambillau C, Desmyter A</author>\n    <category>Anal Biochem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19150325</guid>\n</item>	64	1232518431

Presumably, subsequent secondary mutations increase the stability of the native dimeric state in these variants and, thereby, optimize the catalytic properties of the resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19150359 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Noel AF, Bilsel O, Kundu A, Wu Y, Zitzewitz JA, Matthews CR</author>\n    <category>J Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19150359</guid>\n</item>	16	1233914662

Despite their important role in many functions, only the X-ray structures of rhodopsin, and more recently of the beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenergic receptors, have been resolved. Structural studies of GPCRs require that several tedious preliminary steps be fulfilled before setting up the first crystallization experiments: protein expression, detergent solubilization, purification, and stabilization. Here we report on screening expression conditions of approximately 100 GPCRs in Escherichia coli with a view to obtain large amounts of inclusion bodies, a prerequisite to the subsequent refolding step. A set of optimal conditions, including appropriate vectors (Gateway pDEST17oi), strain (C43), and fermentation at high optical density, define the best first instance choice. Beyond this minimal setting, however, the rate of success increases significantly with the number of conditions tested. In contrast with experiments based on a single GPCR expression, our approach provides statistically significant results and indicates that up to 40% of GPCRs can be expressed as inclusion bodies in quantities sufficient for subsequent refolding, solubilization, and purification.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19150325 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Michalke K, GraviÃ¨re ME, Huyghe C, Vincentelli R, Wagner R, Pattus F, Schroeder K, Oschmann J, Rudolph R, Cambillau C, Desmyter A</author>\n    <category>Anal Biochem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19150325</guid>\n</item>	64	1234008259

To expedite refolding optimization, microwell screening may be used to test multiple conditions in parallel. Fast, accurate, and reproducible assays are required for such screening processes, and the results derived must be representative of the process at full scale. This article demonstrates the use of these microscale techniques to evaluate the effects of a number of additives on the refolding of IGF-1 from denatured inclusion bodies, using an established HPLC assay for this protein. Prior to this, microwell refolding was calibrated for scale-up using hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) as an initial model protein, allowing us to implement and compare several assays for protein refolding, including turbidity, enzyme activity, and chromatographic methods, and assess their use for microwell-based experimentation. The impact of various microplate types upon protein binding and loss is also assessed. Solution mixing is a key factor in protein refolding, therefore we have characterized the effects of different methods of mixing in microwells in terms of their impact on protein refolding. Our results confirm the applicability and scalability of microwell screening for the development of protein refolding processes, and its potential for application to new inclusion body-derived protein products.

Methods: Total RNA was extracted from the placenta tissues of healthy pregnant women undergoing hysterotokotomy and PDGF cDNA was obtained with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The prokaryotic expression vector pET-PDGF-B was constructed and expressed the recombinant PDGF-B in Escherichia coli (E.coli) BL21 (DE3). After purification and refolding on Ni2+-chelation affinity chromatography (NTA) column, it was used to culture cat corneal endothelial cells. Cell proliferation was tested by modified tertrazolium salt (MTT) and flow cytometer. And the morphologic change and the ultrastructure were observed under an inverted phase contrast microscope, a scanning electron microscope and a transmission electon microscope, respectively. Results: PDGF-B chain peptide (PDGF-BB) gene was successfully inserted into the prokaryotic expression vector, pET-28a (+). The purified recombined protein pET-PDGF-B showed a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electropheresis (SDS-PAGE) with the molecular weight of about 27 u, which was in agreement with the deduced value. MTT and flow cytometry showed that PDGF-BB promoted the survival and proliferation of cat corneal endothelial cells. Conclusions: The construction of recombinant prokaryotic expression vector pET-PDGF-B and the preparation of PDGF-BB protein provide a foundation for further study of the function of PDGF-BB and producing biological PDGF-BB protein.

The subsarcolemmal location of dystrophin as well as its association with both cytoskeleton and membrane, suggests a role in the mechanical regulation of muscular membrane stress. In particular, phenotype rescue in DMD mice model has shown that some parts of the central rod domain of dystrophin, constituted by 24 spectrin-like repeats are essential. In this study, we made use of rare missense pathogenic mutations in the dystrophin gene and analysed the biochemical properties of the isolated repeat 23 bearing single or double mutations E2910V and N2912D found in muscle dystrophy with severity grading. No dramatic effect on secondary and tertiary structure of the repeat is found in mutants compared to wild type as revealed by circular dichroism and NMR. Thermal and chemical unfolding data from circular dichroism and tryptophan fluorescence show significant decrease of stability for the mutants and stopped-flow spectroscopy shows decreased refolding rates. The most deleterious single mutation is the N2912D replacement while we observe additive effects of the two mutations on repeat stability. Based on 3D structures built by homology molecular modelling, we discuss the modifications of the mutation induced repeat stability. We conclude that the main forces involved in repeat stability are electrostatic inter-helix interactions which are disrupted following mutations. This work represents the first analysis at the protein level of the consequences of missense mutations in the human dystrophin rod domain. Our results suggest that it may participate in mechanical weakening of dystrophin-deficient muscle.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19158079 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Legardinier S, Legrand B, RaguÃ©nÃ¨s-Nicol C, Bondon A, Hardy S, Tascon C, Le Rumeur E, Hubert JF</author>\n    <category>J Biol Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19158079</guid>\n</item>	2	1235046582

To expedite refolding optimization, microwell screening may be used to test multiple conditions in parallel. Fast, accurate, and reproducible assays are required for such screening processes, and the results derived must be representative of the process at full scale. This article demonstrates the use of these microscale techniques to evaluate the effects of a number of additives on the refolding of IGF-1 from denatured inclusion bodies, using an established HPLC assay for this protein. Prior to this, microwell refolding was calibrated for scale-up using hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) as an initial model protein, allowing us to implement and compare several assays for protein refolding, including turbidity, enzyme activity, and chromatographic methods, and assess their use for microwell-based experimentation. The impact of various microplate types upon protein binding and loss is also assessed. Solution mixing is a key factor in protein refolding, therefore we have characterized the effects of different methods of mixing in microwells in terms of their impact on protein refolding. Our results confirm the applicability and scalability of microwell screening for the development of protein refolding processes, and its potential for application to new inclusion body-derived protein products.

METHODS: Molecular cloning of the beta subunit gene of chaperonin from the thermoacidophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 was performed by using PCR technique. The gene was expressed in BL21 (DE3) of Escherichia coli. After purified and assembled in vitro, the structure of the beta subunit homo-oligomer was observed by transmission electron microscope (TEM). The function of this homo-oligomer as a chaperonin was evaluated. RESULTS: The gene encoding beta subunit of chaperonin was amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 and expressed in BL21 (DE3) of E. coli. In vitro, the purified beta monomer could assemble to a homo-oligomer in the presence of ATP and Mg2+. As observed by transmission electron microscope(TEM), the beta subunit homo-oligomer (beta16mer) showed a double-ring structure, which is typical in group II chaperonins. The optimum temperature for ATPase activity of the beta16mer was 80 degrees C. The beta16mer was able to promote the refolding of denatured GFP and improve the thermostability of xylanase. CONCLUSION: According to the prediction and analysis of the chaperonin sequence from thermoacidophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 genome, we cloned and expressed the beta subunit of chaperonin from P2. This subunit formed a homo-oligomer in vitro and showed a typical structure of group II chaperonins. We found that the beta16mer was able to function correctly when promoting the refolding and improving the thermostability of some other proteins.

Importantly, the rate of this process in vivo is accelerated by prolyl isomerases (PPIases). The archetypal PPIase is the human cyclophilin 18 (Cyp18 or CypA), and Arg 55 has been demonstrated to play a crucial role when studying short peptide substrates in the catalytic action of Cyp18 by stabilizing the transition state of isomerization. However, in this study we show that a R55A mutant of Cyp18 is as efficient as the wild type to accelerate the refolding reaction of human carbonic anhydrase II (HCA II). Thus, it is evident that the active-site located Arg 55 is not required for catalysis of the rate-limiting prolyl cis-trans isomerization steps during the folding of a protein substrate as HCA II. Nevertheless, catalysis of cis-trans proline isomerization in HCA II occurs in the active-site of Cyp18, since binding of the inhibitor cyclosporin A abolishes rate acceleration of the refolding reaction. Obviously, the catalytic mechanisms of Cyp18 can differ when acting upon a simple model peptide, four residues long, with easily accessible Pro residues compared with a large protein molecule undergoing folding with partly or completely buried Pro residues. In the latter case, the isomerization kinetics are significantly slower and simpler mechanistic factors such as desolvation and/or strain might operate during folding-assisted catalysis, since binding to the hydrophobic active site is still a prerequisite for catalysis.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19185003 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Moparthi SB, HammarstrÃ¶m P, Carlsson U</author>\n    <category>Protein Sci</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19185003</guid>\n</item>	11	1235462732

However, arginine does not work for certain disulfide-bond-containing proteins, which is not yet well explained. In this work, refolding of three proteins in the presence of 0-2 M arginine was investigated and compared. Bovine carbonic anhydrase B (CAB), containing no cysteine, was successfully refolded with the help of arginine. The refolding yield could reach almost 100% in the presence of 0.75 M arginine. However, recombinant human colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF), containing five cysteines, could only achieve 65% refolding yield. The formation of aggregates was found. Blocking of free SH groups of the denatured rhG-CSF by iodoacetamide and subsequently refolding of the protein could reduce the aggregate formation substantially. Further investigation on recombinant green fluorescence protein (GFP), containing two cysteines, also revealed the accumulation of oligomers. The content of oligomers increased with the concentration of arginine, reaching about 30% at 2 M arginine. Comparison of reduced and nonreduced SDS-PAGE revealed that the oligomers were formed through intermolecular disulfide binding. Analysis of the refolding kinetics indicated that intermolecular disulfide bonds were probably formed in the intermediate stage where arginine slowed down the refolding rate and stabilized the intermediates. The accumulated intermediates with unpaired cysteine possessed more chances to react with each other to form oligomers, whereas arginine failed to inhibit disulfide bond formation.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19194951 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Chen J, Liu Y, Wang Y, Ding H, Su Z</author>\n    <category>Biotechnol Prog</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19194951</guid>\n</item>	7	1235801056

Lower refolding yields of alginate beads compared with its soluble form may be the result of lower refolding rate of ALP upon elution of the bound enzyme by dispersing the precipitate in NaCl which left the unfolded protein in an unsuitable environment, providing enough time for protein aggregation and leading finally to lower recovered activity compared with application of soluble form of alginate.

Especially important is the C-terminus of P22 TSP, which plays a critical role in the assembly and maturation of the protrimer intermediate to its final trimeric form. In this paper, we show that by grafting the C-terminus of TSP onto the monomeric maltose binding protein (MBP), the resulting chimera (MBP-537) is a trimeric protein. Moreover, Western blot studies (using an anti-TSP antibody) indicate that the TSP C-terminus in the MBP-537 chimera has the same conformation as the native TSP. The oligomerization of the MBP-537 chimera appears to involve hydrophobic interactions and a refolding sequence, both of which are analogous to the native TSP.

Capsid shells are complex organizations of hundreds of protein subunits that assemble into intricate quaternary complexes that ultimately are able to withstand over 50 atm of pressure during genome packaging. The extensive integration between subunits in capsids requires the formation of an intermediate complex, termed a procapsid, from which individual subunits can undergo the necessary refolding and structural rearrangements needed to transition to the more stable capsid. Although various mature capsids have been characterized at atomic resolution, no such procapsid structure is available for a dsDNA virus or bacteriophage. Here we present a procapsid X-ray structure at 3.65 A resolution, termed prohead II, of the lambda-like bacteriophage HK97, the mature capsid structure of which was previously solved to 3.44 A (ref. 2). A comparison of the two largely different capsid forms has unveiled an unprecedented expansion mechanism that describes the transition. Crystallographic and hydrogen/deuterium exchange data presented here demonstrate that the subunit tertiary structures are significantly different between the two states, with twisting and bending motions occurring in both helical and beta-sheet regions. We also identified subunit interactions at each three-fold axis of the capsid that are maintained throughout maturation.

Capsid shells are complex organizations of hundreds of protein subunits that assemble into intricate quaternary complexes that ultimately are able to withstand over 50 atm of pressure during genome packaging. The extensive integration between subunits in capsids requires the formation of an intermediate complex, termed a procapsid, from which individual subunits can undergo the necessary refolding and structural rearrangements needed to transition to the more stable capsid. Although various mature capsids have been characterized at atomic resolution, no such procapsid structure is available for a dsDNA virus or bacteriophage. Here we present a procapsid X-ray structure at 3.65 A resolution, termed prohead II, of the lambda-like bacteriophage HK97, the mature capsid structure of which was previously solved to 3.44 A (ref. 2). A comparison of the two largely different capsid forms has unveiled an unprecedented expansion mechanism that describes the transition. Crystallographic and hydrogen/deuterium exchange data presented here demonstrate that the subunit tertiary structures are significantly different between the two states, with twisting and bending motions occurring in both helical and beta-sheet regions. We also identified subunit interactions at each three-fold axis of the capsid that are maintained throughout maturation. The interactions sustain capsid integrity during subunit refolding and provide a fixed hinge from which subunits undergo rotational and translational motions during maturation. Previously published calorimetric data of a closely related bacteriophage, P22, showed that capsid maturation was an exothermic process that resulted in a release of 90 kJ mol(-1) of energy.

We characterized two types of chloroplast cpn60 oligomers, ch-cpn60 composed of alpha and beta subunits (alpha(7)beta(7) ch-cpn60) and one composed of all beta subunits (beta(14) ch-cpn60). In terms of ATPase activity, the rate of ATP hydrolysis increased with protein concentration up to 60 muM, reflecting a concentration at which the oligomers are stable. At high concentrations of cpn60, all cpn10 homologs inhibited ATPase activity of alpha(7)beta(7) ch-cpn60. In contrast, ATPase of beta(14) ch-cpn60 was inhibited only by mitochondrial cpn10, supporting previous reports showing that beta(14) is functional only with mitochondrial cpn10 and not with other cpn10 homologs. Surprisingly, direct binding assays showed that both ch-cpn60 oligomer types bind to bacterial, mitochondrial, and chloroplast cpn10 homologs with an equal apparent affinity. Moreover, mitochondrial cpn60 binds chloroplast cpn20 with which it is not able to refold denatured proteins. Protein refolding experiments showed that in such instances, the bound protein is released in a conformation that is not able to refold. The presence of glycerol, or subsequent addition of mitochondrial cpn10, allows us to recover enzymatic activity of the substrate protein. Thus, in our systems, the formation of co-chaperonin/chaperonin complexes does not necessarily lead to protein folding. By using heterologous oligomer systems, we are able to separate the functions of binding and refolding in order to better understand the chaperonin mechanism.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19224397 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Bonshtien AL, Parnas A, Sharkia R, Niv A, Mizrahi I, Azem A, Weiss C</author>\n    <category>Cell Stress Chaperones</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19224397</guid>\n</item>	0	1236246703

However, no studies have yet examined whether these substances can exert synergistic or cooperative effects when used in combination. In this work, a comparative study was carried out on refolding of recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) in the presence of different concentrations of urea, guanidinium chloride or arginine. All three folding aids could inhibit the formation of insoluble aggregates of rhG-CSF but with different efficacies. A low concentration of guanidinium chloride was found to denature protein, so that rhG-CSF was not fully or correctly folded even if concentration was reduced to 1 M. Low concentration of urea (2 M) or arginine (0.5 M) did not cause rhG-CSF denaturation, but urea was unable to suppress the formation of soluble oligomers, which persisted at a level of about 30% in refolded soluble rhG-CSF. Arginine, in contrast, could inhibit formation of all soluble oligomers. Based on these phenomena, we tested rhG-CSF folding in a mixture of 2 M urea and 0.5 M arginine. Kinetic analysis indicated that urea aided in suppressing insoluble precipitates, while arginine prevented formation of soluble oligomers produced by hydrophobic interaction. With this combination system, the refolding yield of rhG-CSF could be increased 2 fold.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19233287 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Chen J, Liu Y, Li X, Wang Y, Ding H, Ma G, Su Z</author>\n    <category>Protein Expr Purif</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19233287</guid>\n</item>	0	1235542003

It originates largely, if not entirely, from the two-stranded beta sheet at the base of the Pro161 hairpin. The two strands improve their stabilizing interactions when Pro161 is cis, and this stabilization is propagated to Pro161, because the connector peptides between the beta strands and Pro161 are native-like folded when Pro161 is cis. In the presence of a trans Pro161, the connector peptides are locally unfolded, and thus Pro161 is structurally and energetically uncoupled from the beta sheet.

In this work, a comparative study was carried out on refolding of recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) in the presence of different concentrations of urea, guanidinium chloride or arginine. All three folding aids could inhibit the formation of insoluble aggregates of rhG-CSF but with different efficacies. A low concentration of guanidinium chloride was found to denature protein, so that rhG-CSF was not fully or correctly folded even if concentration was reduced to 1 M.

Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) protects cellular elements from injury by reducing oxidation, inflammation and apoptosis and by refolding damaged proteins. HSP70 improves viability of stressed vascular smooth muscle cells, possibly via its chaperone functions. It has been proposed that the response mounted against bacterial HSPs results in an autoimmune reaction, which has the potential to cause complement-mediated endothelial injury, and hence accelerate atherogenesis. Objective: to examine the roles of HSPs in atherosclerosis. Methods: A literature review. Results/Conclusions: The role of HSPs in atherosclerosis is controversial. HSP60 probably acts as an autoantigen, and may trigger both cell- and antibody-mediated immune responses, while HSP70 is likely to be involved in cytoprotection. The significance of this inverse relation between HSP70 and atherosclerosis has not yet been elucidated. Whether HSPs will become therapeutic targets remains to be established.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19236153 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Bielecka-Dabrowa A, Barylski M, Mikhailidis DP, Rysz J, Banach M</author>\n    <category>Expert Opin Ther Targets</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19236153</guid>\n</item>	253	1235659502

For alphaviruses such as Semliki Forest virus (SFV), acidic pH initiates a series of conformational changes in the heterodimeric virus envelope proteins E1 and E2. Low pH dissociates the E2/E1 dimer releasing the membrane fusion protein E1. E1 inserts into the target membrane and refolds to a trimeric hairpin conformation, thus driving the fusion reaction. The means by which E1 senses and responds to low pH is unclear, and protonation of conserved E1 histidine residues has been proposed as a possible mechanism. We tested the role of 4 conserved histidines by mutagenesis of the SFV infectious clone to create E1 H3A, H125A, H331A, and H331A/H333A virus mutants. The H125A, H331A, and H331A/H333A mutants had growth properties similar to those of wt SFV and showed modest or no change in the pH-dependence of virus-membrane fusion. By contrast, the E1 H3A mutation produced impaired virus growth and a markedly more acidic pH requirement for virus-membrane fusion. The dissociation of the H3A heterodimer and the membrane insertion of the mutant E1 protein were comparable to wt in efficiency and pH dependence. However, the formation of the H3A homotrimer required a much lower pH and showed reduced efficiency. Together these results and the location of H3 suggest that this residue acts to regulate the low pH-dependent refolding of E1 during membrane fusion.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19244325 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Qin ZL, Zheng Y, Kielian M</author>\n    <category>J Virol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19244325</guid>\n</item>	23	1237535998

The protein oligomer is modeled as a heterogeneous, freely jointed chain with two possible values of Kuhn length and contour length representing its folded and unfolded configurations. We obtain analytical solutions for the force-extension response of the protein oligomer for different types of loading conditions. We fit the analytical solutions for constant-velocity pulling to the force-extension data for ubiquitin and fibrinogen and obtain model parameters, such as Kuhn lengths and kinetic coefficients, for both proteins. We then predict their response under a linearly increasing force and find that our solutions for ubiquitin are consistent with a different set of experiments. Our calculations suggest that the refolding rate of proteins at low forces is several orders larger than the unfolding rate, and neglecting it can lead to lower predictions for the unfolding force, especially at high stretching velocities. By accounting for the refolding of proteins we obtain a critical force below which equilibrium is biased in favor of the folded state. Our calculations also suggest new methods to determine the distance of the transition state from the energy wells representing the folded and unfolded states of a protein.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19251493 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Su T, Purohit PK</author>\n    <category>Acta Biomater</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19251493</guid>\n</item>	0	1236146762

The protein oligomer is modeled as a heterogeneous, freely jointed chain with two possible values of Kuhn length and contour length representing its folded and unfolded configurations. We obtain analytical solutions for the force-extension response of the protein oligomer for different types of loading conditions. We fit the analytical solutions for constant-velocity pulling to the force-extension data for ubiquitin and fibrinogen and obtain model parameters, such as Kuhn lengths and kinetic coefficients, for both proteins. We then predict their response under a linearly increasing force and find that our solutions for ubiquitin are consistent with a different set of experiments. Our calculations suggest that the refolding rate of proteins at low forces is several orders larger than the unfolding rate, and neglecting it can lead to lower predictions for the unfolding force, especially at high stretching velocities. By accounting for the refolding of proteins we obtain a critical force below which equilibrium is biased in favor of the folded state. Our calculations also suggest new methods to determine the distance of the transition state from the energy wells representing the folded and unfolded states of a protein.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19251493 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Su T, Purohit PK</author>\n    <category>Acta Biomater</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19251493</guid>\n</item>	0	1237894202

Results from equilibrium chemical denaturation experiments were consistent with a two-state folding mechanism, but showed only partial reversibility. Stopped-flow fluorescence studies showed a single unfolding step, but two refolding steps. The slow refolding step could be partly attributed to proline isomerization, based on an increased rate during refolding in the presence of PPIase and an increased relative amplitude of this step with increasing delay time in double-jump refolding experiments observed over delays of 5-100 s. However, double-jump refolding experiments with delay times longer than 100 s along with size exclusion chromatography and dynamic light scattering of refolding samples showed that the overall refolding yield decreased as bhx was unfolded for longer periods of time. Furthermore, the losses resulted from aggregate formation during refolding. This suggests that a change occurs over time in the unfolded or denatured state ensemble that increases the propensity for aggregation upon the shift to more native-favoring conditions.

Despite its importance in modern biophysics, the current understanding of RNA folding kinetics is limited by the complex interplay between the weak base pair interactions that stabilize the native structure and the disordering effect of thermal forces. The possibility of mechanically pulling individual molecules offers a new perspective to understand the folding of nucleic acids. Here we investigate the folding and misfolding mechanism in RNA secondary structures pulled by mechanical forces. We introduce a model based on the identification of the minimal set of structures that reproduce the patterns of force-extension curves obtained in single molecule experiments. The model requires only two fitting parameters: the attempt frequency at the level of individual base pairs and a parameter associated to a free-energy correction that accounts for the configurational entropy of an exponentially large number of neglected secondary structures. We apply the model to interpret results recently obtained in pulling experiments in the three-helix junction S15 RNA molecule (RNAS15). We show that RNAS15 undergoes force-induced misfolding where force favors the formation of a stable non-native hairpin. The model reproduces the pattern of unfolding and refolding force-extension curves, the distribution of breakage forces, and the misfolding probability obtained in the experiments.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19256886 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Manosas M, Junier I, Ritort F</author>\n    <category>Phys Rev E Stat Nonlin Soft Matter Phys</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19256886</guid>\n</item>	0	1236263024

The protein was refolded by dilution in a L-arginine refolding buffer and refined by anion chromatography. The protein activity was detected by cytokine-dependent cell proliferation assay. RESULTS: The expression of hIL-2/mGM-CSF in E. coli yielded approximately 20 mg protein /L culture and the purity was about 90%. The specific activities of IL-2 and GM-CSF were 5.4 x 10(6) IU/mg and 7.1 x 10(6) IU/mg, respectively. CONCLUSION: This research provides important information about the anti-tumor activity of hIL-2/mGM-CSF in vivo, thus facilitating future clinical research on hIL-2/mGM-CSF used in immune therapy.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19263807 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Wen Q, Ma L, Luo W, Zhou MQ, Wang XN</author>\n    <category>Biomed Environ Sci</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19263807</guid>\n</item>	6	1238640337

Accordingly haemolytic disease is a major consequence of G6PD deficiency mutations in man, and many severe disease phenotypes are attributed to G6PD folding problems. Therefore, a robust refolding method with high recovery yield and reproducibility is of particular importance to study those clinical mutant enzymes as well as to shed light generally on the refolding process of large multi-domain proteins. RESULTS: The effects of different chemical and physical variables on the refolding of human recombinant G6PD have been extensively investigated. L-Arg, NADP+ and DTT are all major positive influences on refolding, and temperature, protein concentration, salt types and other additives also have significant impacts. With the method described here, ~70% enzyme activity could be regained, with good reproducibility, after denaturation with Gdn-HCl, by rapid dilution of the protein, and the refolded enzyme displays kinetic and CD properties indistinguishable from those of the native protein. Refolding under these conditions is relatively slow, taking about 7 days to complete at room temperature even in the presence of cyclophilin A, a peptidylprolyl isomerase reported to increase refolding rates. The refolded protein intermediates shift from dominant monomer to dimer during this process, the gradual emergence of dimer correlating well with the regain of enzyme activity. CONCLUSIONS: L-Arg is the key player in the refolding of human G6PD, preventing the aggregation of folding intermediate, and NADP+ is essential for the folding intermediate to adopt native structure. The refolding protocol can be applied to produce high recovery yield of folded protein with unaltered properties, paving the way for future studies on clinical G6PD mutants with folding defects and providing a useful model system to study the folding process of oligomeric proteins.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19284595 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Wang XT, Engel PC</author>\n    <category>BMC Biotechnol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19284595</guid>\n</item>	44	1237294821

These studies require expensive and complicated equipment. In this paper we present a new convenient method for studying high-pressure denaturation of proteins combining deuterium-hydrogen exchange and electrospray mass spectrometry. Application of various values of pressure causes different degrees of protein unfolding resulting in molecules with a different number of protons available for exchange with deuterons. After decompression a protein refolds and a certain number of deuterons is trapped within the hydrophobic core of a refolded protein. Redissolving the deuterated protein in an aqueous buffer initiates the D/H exchange of amides located on the protein surface only, which can be monitored under atmospheric pressure by mass spectrometry. Depending on the degree of deuteration after high pressure treatment, the D/H exchange kinetics are different and indicate how many deuterons were trapped in the protein after refolding. The dependence of this number on pressure gives information on the denaturation state of a protein. The distribution of deuterium along the sequence of a high- pressure-denatured protein was studied the electron capture dissociation (ECD) on a Fourier-transform mass spectrometer, enabling the monitoring of high pressure denaturation with single amino acid resolution.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19284386 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Stefanowicz P, Petry-Podgorska I, Kowalewska K, Jaremko L, Jaremko M, Szewczuk Z</author>\n    <category>Biosci Rep</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19284386</guid>\n</item>	0	1237294821

Accordingly haemolytic disease is a major consequence of G6PD deficiency mutations in man, and many severe disease phenotypes are attributed to G6PD folding problems. Therefore, a robust refolding method with high recovery yield and reproducibility is of particular importance to study those clinical mutant enzymes as well as to shed light generally on the refolding process of large multi-domain proteins. RESULTS: The effects of different chemical and physical variables on the refolding of human recombinant G6PD have been extensively investigated. L-Arg, NADP+ and DTT are all major positive influences on refolding, and temperature, protein concentration, salt types and other additives also have significant impacts. With the method described here, ~70% enzyme activity could be regained, with good reproducibility, after denaturation with Gdn-HCl, by rapid dilution of the protein, and the refolded enzyme displays kinetic and CD properties indistinguishable from those of the native protein. Refolding under these conditions is relatively slow, taking about 7 days to complete at room temperature even in the presence of cyclophilin A, a peptidylprolyl isomerase reported to increase refolding rates. The refolded protein intermediates shift from dominant monomer to dimer during this process, the gradual emergence of dimer correlating well with the regain of enzyme activity. CONCLUSIONS: L-Arg is the key player in the refolding of human G6PD, preventing the aggregation of folding intermediate, and NADP+ is essential for the folding intermediate to adopt native structure. The refolding protocol can be applied to produce high recovery yield of folded protein with unaltered properties, paving the way for future studies on clinical G6PD mutants with folding defects and providing a useful model system to study the folding process of oligomeric proteins.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19284595 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Wang XT, Engel PC</author>\n    <category>BMC Biotechnol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19284595</guid>\n</item>	44	1237324281

We report here the crystal structure of native human neuroserpin at 2.1A resolution. The structure has a helical reactive centre loop and an omega loop between strands 1B and 2B. The omega loop contributes to the inhibition of tPA as deletion of this motif reduced the association rate constant with tPA three fold but had no effect on the kinetics of interaction with urokinase. Point mutations in neuroserpin cause the formation of ordered intracellular polymers that underlie the dementia familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies or FENIB. Wildtype neuroserpin is also unstable and readily forms polymers under near-physiological conditions in vitro. This is in part due to the substitution of a conserved alanine for serine at position 340. The replacement of Ser340 by Ala increased the melting temperature by 3 degrees C and reduced polymerization when compared to wildtype neuroserpin. Similarly neuroserpin has Asn-Leu-Val at the end of helix F and so differs markedly from the Gly-X-Ile consensus sequence of the serpins. Restoration of these amino acids to the consensus sequence increased thermal stability and reduced the polymerization of neuroserpin and its transition to the latent conformer. Moreover introduction of the consensus sequence into S49P neuroserpin that causes FENIB increased the stability and inhibitory activity of the mutant as well as blocking polymerization and increasing the yield of protein during refolding. These data provide a molecular explanation for the inherent instability of neuroserpin and the effect of point mutations that underlie the dementia FENIB.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19285087 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Takehara S, Onda M, Zhang J, Nishiyama M, Yang X, Mikami B, Lomas DA</author>\n    <category>J Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19285087</guid>\n</item>	13	1237324327

Application of various values of pressure causes different degrees of protein unfolding resulting in molecules with a different number of protons available for exchange with deuterons. After decompression a protein refolds and a certain number of deuterons is trapped within the hydrophobic core of a refolded protein. Redissolving the deuterated protein in an aqueous buffer initiates the D/H exchange of amides located on the protein surface only, which can be monitored under atmospheric pressure by mass spectrometry. Depending on the degree of deuteration after high pressure treatment, the D/H exchange kinetics are different and indicate how many deuterons were trapped in the protein after refolding. The dependence of this number on pressure gives information on the denaturation state of a protein. The distribution of deuterium along the sequence of a high- pressure-denatured protein was studied the electron capture dissociation (ECD) on a Fourier-transform mass spectrometer, enabling the monitoring of high pressure denaturation with single amino acid resolution.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19284386 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Stefanowicz P, Petry-Podgorska I, Kowalewska K, Jaremko L, Jaremko M, Szewczuk Z</author>\n    <category>Biosci Rep</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19284386</guid>\n</item>	0	1239960008

PfuTIM shows comparable structural contents at pH 3.0, 7.0 and 10.0. However, at pH 3.0, subtle changes are seen in the protein's surface hydrophobicity and association status, and its kinetic thermal stability is profoundly reduced (as evidenced by its facile heat- and cold-mediated denaturation, characterized by a high degree of hysteresis and irreversibility). Increase in ionic strength through addition of salt counters the reduction of stability, and reversal of pH facilitates partial refolding.

The Hsp90 complex is one of the chaperones that facilitate the refolding of unfolded or misfolded proteins and plays a role for key oncogenic proteins such as Her2, Raf-1, Akt/PKB, and mutant p53. NVP-AUY922 is a novel low-molecular Hsp90 inhibitor, currently under clinical development as an anticancer drug. Disruption of the Hsp90-client protein complexes leads to proteasome-mediated degradation of client proteins and cell death. The aim of the current study was to use a combination of the multicellular tumour spheroid (MTS) model and positron emission tomography (PET) to investigate the effects of NVP-AUY922 on tumour growth and its relation to PET tracer uptake for the selection of appropriate PET tracer. A further aim was to evaluate the concentration and time dependence in the relation between growth inhibition and PET tracer uptake as part of translational imaging activities. METHODS: MTS of two breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and BT474), one glioblastoma cell line (U87MG) and one colon carcinoma cell line (HCT116) were prepared. Initially, we investigated MTS growth pattern and (3)H-thymidine incorporation in MTS after continuous exposure to NVP-AUY922 in order to determine dose response. Then the short-term effect of the drug on the four PET tracers 2-[(18)F] fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG), 3'-deoxy-3'-fluorothymidine (FLT), methionine and choline was correlated to the long-term effect (changes in growth pattern) to determine the adequate PET tracer with high predictability. Next, the growth inhibitory effect of different dose schedules was evaluated to determine the optimal dose and time. Finally, the effect of a 2-h exposure to the drug on growth pattern and FDG/FLT uptake was evaluated. RESULTS: A dose-dependent inhibition of growth and decrease of (3)H-thymidine uptake was observed with 100% growth cessation in the dose range 7-52 nM and 50% (3)H-thymidine reduction in the range of 10-23 nM, with the most pronounced effect on BT474 cells. The effect of the drug was best detected by FLT. The results suggested that a complete cessation of growth of the viable cell volume was achieved with about 50% inhibition of FLT uptake 3 days after continuous treatment. Significant growth inhibition was observed at all doses and all exposure time spans. Two-hour exposure to NVP-AUY922 generated a growth inhibition which persisted dose dependently up to 10 days. The uptake of FDG per viable tumour volume was reduced by just 25% with 300 nM treatment of the drug, whereas the FLT uptake decreased up to 75% in correlation with the growth inhibition and recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a prolonged action of NVP-AUY922 in this cell culture, FLT is a suitable tracer for the monitoring of the effect and a FLT PET study within 3 days after treatment can predict the treatment outcome in this model. If relevant in vivo, this information can be used for efficient planning of animal PET studies and later human PET trial.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19324279 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Monazzam A, Razifar P, Ide S, Rugaard Jensen M, Josephsson R, Blomqvist C, LangstrÃ¶m B, BergstrÃ¶m M</author>\n    <category>Nucl Med Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19324279</guid>\n</item>	67	1238371669

However, over-production of heterologous proteins in E. coli frequently leads to their misfolding and aggregation yielding inclusion bodies. Previous attempts to refold the inclusion bodies into bioactive forms usually result in poor recovery and account for the major cost in industrial production of desired proteins from recombinant E. coli. Here, we describe the successful use of the immobilized folding machineries for in vitro refolding with the examples of high yield refolding of a ribonuclease A (RNase A) and cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMO). RESULTS: We have generated refolding-facilitating media immobilized with three folding machineries, mini-chaperone (a monomeric apical domain consisting of residues 191-345 of GroEL) and two foldases (DsbA and human peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase) by mimicking oxidative refolding chromatography. For efficient and simple purification and immobilization simultaneously, folding machineries were fused with the positively-charged consecutive 10-arginine tag at their C-terminal. The immobilized folding machineries were fully functional when assayed in a batch mode. When the refolding-facilitating matrices were applied to the refolding of denatured and reduced RNase A and CHMO, both of which contain many cysteine and proline residues, RNase A and CHMO were recovered in 73% and 53% yield of soluble protein with full enzyme activity, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The refolding-facilitating media presented here could be a cost-efficient platform and should be applicable to refold a wide range of E. coli inclusion bodies in high yield with biological function.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19323835 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Lee DH, Kim SG, Kweon DH, Seo JH</author>\n    <category>BMC Biotechnol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19323835</guid>\n</item>	252	1238371669

However, over-production of heterologous proteins in E. coli frequently leads to their misfolding and aggregation yielding inclusion bodies. Previous attempts to refold the inclusion bodies into bioactive forms usually result in poor recovery and account for the major cost in industrial production of desired proteins from recombinant E. coli. Here, we describe the successful use of the immobilized folding machineries for in vitro refolding with the examples of high yield refolding of a ribonuclease A (RNase A) and cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMO). RESULTS: We have generated refolding-facilitating media immobilized with three folding machineries, mini-chaperone (a monomeric apical domain consisting of residues 191-345 of GroEL) and two foldases (DsbA and human peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase) by mimicking oxidative refolding chromatography. For efficient and simple purification and immobilization simultaneously, folding machineries were fused with the positively-charged consecutive 10-arginine tag at their C-terminal. The immobilized folding machineries were fully functional when assayed in a batch mode. When the refolding-facilitating matrices were applied to the refolding of denatured and reduced RNase A and CHMO, both of which contain many cysteine and proline residues, RNase A and CHMO were recovered in 73% and 53% yield of soluble protein with full enzyme activity, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The refolding-facilitating media presented here could be a cost-efficient platform and should be applicable to refold a wide range of E. coli inclusion bodies in high yield with biological function.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19323835 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Lee DH, Kim SG, Kweon DH, Seo JH</author>\n    <category>BMC Biotechnol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19323835</guid>\n</item>	252	1240917154

The Hsp90 complex is one of the chaperones that facilitate the refolding of unfolded or misfolded proteins and plays a role for key oncogenic proteins such as Her2, Raf-1, Akt/PKB, and mutant p53. NVP-AUY922 is a novel low-molecular Hsp90 inhibitor, currently under clinical development as an anticancer drug. Disruption of the Hsp90-client protein complexes leads to proteasome-mediated degradation of client proteins and cell death. The aim of the current study was to use a combination of the multicellular tumour spheroid (MTS) model and positron emission tomography (PET) to investigate the effects of NVP-AUY922 on tumour growth and its relation to PET tracer uptake for the selection of appropriate PET tracer. A further aim was to evaluate the concentration and time dependence in the relation between growth inhibition and PET tracer uptake as part of translational imaging activities. METHODS: MTS of two breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and BT474), one glioblastoma cell line (U87MG) and one colon carcinoma cell line (HCT116) were prepared. Initially, we investigated MTS growth pattern and (3)H-thymidine incorporation in MTS after continuous exposure to NVP-AUY922 in order to determine dose response. Then the short-term effect of the drug on the four PET tracers 2-[(18)F] fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG), 3'-deoxy-3'-fluorothymidine (FLT), methionine and choline was correlated to the long-term effect (changes in growth pattern) to determine the adequate PET tracer with high predictability. Next, the growth inhibitory effect of different dose schedules was evaluated to determine the optimal dose and time. Finally, the effect of a 2-h exposure to the drug on growth pattern and FDG/FLT uptake was evaluated. RESULTS: A dose-dependent inhibition of growth and decrease of (3)H-thymidine uptake was observed with 100% growth cessation in the dose range 7-52 nM and 50% (3)H-thymidine reduction in the range of 10-23 nM, with the most pronounced effect on BT474 cells. The effect of the drug was best detected by FLT. The results suggested that a complete cessation of growth of the viable cell volume was achieved with about 50% inhibition of FLT uptake 3 days after continuous treatment. Significant growth inhibition was observed at all doses and all exposure time spans. Two-hour exposure to NVP-AUY922 generated a growth inhibition which persisted dose dependently up to 10 days. The uptake of FDG per viable tumour volume was reduced by just 25% with 300 nM treatment of the drug, whereas the FLT uptake decreased up to 75% in correlation with the growth inhibition and recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a prolonged action of NVP-AUY922 in this cell culture, FLT is a suitable tracer for the monitoring of the effect and a FLT PET study within 3 days after treatment can predict the treatment outcome in this model.

Folding and unfolding, in urea as well as in guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl), were studied by monitoring changes in the intrinsic fluorescence or in the far-UV circular dichroism (CD) of the protein. The two probes yield non-coincident equilibrium transitions for unfolding in urea, indicating that an intermediate, I, exists in equilibrium with native (N) and unfolded (U) protein, during unfolding. Hence, the equilibrium unfolding data were analyzed according to a three-state N &lt;--&gt; I &lt;--&gt; U mechanism. An intermediate is observed also in kinetic unfolding studies, and its presence leads to the unfolding reaction in urea as well as in GdnHCl, occurring in two steps. The fast step is complete within the initial 11 ms of unfolding and manifests itself in a burst phase change in fluorescence. At high concentrations of GdnHCl, the entire change in fluorescence during unfolding occurs during the 11 ms burst phase. CD measurements indicate, however, that I retains N-like secondary structure. An analysis of the kinetic and thermodynamic data, according to a minimal three-state N &lt;--&gt; I &lt;--&gt; U mechanism, positions I after the rate-limiting transition state, TS1, of folding, on the reaction coordinate of folding in GdnHCl. Hence, I is not revealed when folding is commenced from U, regardless of the nature of the probe used to follow the folding reaction. Interrupted unfolding experiments, in which the protein is unfolded transiently in GdnHCl for various lengths of time before being refolded, showed that I refolds to N much faster than does U, confirms the analysis of the direct folding and unfolding experiments, that I is formed after the rate-limiting step of refolding in GdnHCl.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19356591 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Wani AH, Udgaonkar JB</author>\n    <category>J Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19356591</guid>\n</item>	0	1239368658

PreMBP, the precursor form of maltose binding protein, has a 26-residue signal sequence attached to the N-terminus of MBP and is a physiological substrate of SecB. We examine the effect of macromolecular crowding and SecB on the stability and refolding of denatured preMBP and MBP. PreMBP was less stable than MBP (DeltaT(m )= 7 +/- 0.5 K) in both crowded and uncrowded solutions. Crowding did not cause any substantial changes in the thermal stability of MBP (DeltaT(m )= 1 +/- 0.4 K) or preMBP (DeltaT(m )= 0 +/- 0.6 K), as observed in spectroscopically monitored thermal unfolding experiments. However, both MBP and preMBP were prone to aggregation while refolding under crowded conditions. In contrast to MBP aggregates, which were amorphous, preMBP aggregates form amyloid fibrils. Under uncrowded conditions, a molar excess of SecB was able to completely prevent aggregation and promote disaggregation of preformed aggregates of MBP. When a complex of the denatured protein and SecB was preformed, SecB could completely prevent aggregation and promote folding of MBP and preMBP even in crowded solution. Thus, in addition to maintaining substrates in an unfolded, export-competent conformation, SecB also suppresses the aggregation of its substrates in the crowded intracellular environment. SecB is also able to promote passive disaggregation of macroscopic aggregates of MBP in the absence of an energy source such as ATP or additional cofactors.

The method has been successfully applied in the separation and purification of antibodies and other proteins. However, little is understood about protein conformational transition and the dynamic process within adsorbent pores. In the present study, a pore model is established to represent the realistic porous adsorbent composed of matrix and immobilized HCIC ligands. Protein adsorption, desorption, and conformational transition in the HCIC pore and its implications to the separation performance are shown by a molecular dynamics simulation of a 46-bead beta-barrel coarse-grained model protein in the adsorbent pore. Repeated adjustment of both protein position and orientation is observed before reaching a stable adsorption. Once the protein is adsorbed, there is a dynamic equilibrium between unfolding and refolding. The effect of hydrophobic interaction strength between protein and ligands on adsorption phenomena is then examined. Strong hydrophobic interaction, representing the presence of high-concentration lyotropic salt in mobile phase, can speed up the adsorption but cause protein unfolding more significantly. On the contrary, weak hydrophobic interaction, representing the absence of a lyotropic salt or the presence of a chaotropic agent, can reserve native protein conformation but does not lead to stable adsorption. In the elution, protein unfolding occurs due to simultaneous hydrophobic adsorption and electrostatic repulsion in the opposite directions. When the protein has been desorbed, the conformational transition between unfolded and native protein is still observed due to the long-range nature of electrostatic interaction.

HO-penCB and HO-hexCB markedly inhibited the binding of T(3) to PDI. However, nonhydroxylated PCBs did not show any interaction with PDI. The effects of PCBs and HO-PCBs on PDI activity were also investigated using an RNaseA refolding assay. Both HO-PCBs inhibited the oxidative refolding of reduced RNaseA by PDI. We also assessed the effects of HO-PCBs and PCBs on the chaperone activity of PDI, which was measured by a thermal aggregation assay, and found that neither HO-PCBs nor PCBs have significant inhibitory or promoting effects.

These findings suggest that the metabolites of PCBs have the potential to cause defective protein folding via PDI.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19374345 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Okada K, Hashimoto S, Funae Y, Imaoka S</author>\n    <category>Chem Res Toxicol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19374345</guid>\n</item>	23	1242122688

Previous studies showed that the S. cerevisiae cytosolic/nuclear DEAD-box protein Ded1p could stimulate group II intron splicing in vitro. Here, we show that Ded1p complements the mitochondrial translation and group I and II intron splicing defects in mss116Delta strains, stimulates the in vitro splicing of group I as well as group II introns, and functions indistinguishably from CYT-19 to resolve different non-native secondary and/or tertiary structures in the Tetrahymena thermophila LSU-DeltaP5abc group I intron. The Escherichia coli DEAD-box protein SrmB also stimulates group I and II intron splicing in vitro, while the E. coli DEAD-box protein DbpA and vaccinia virus DExH-box protein NPH-II gave little if any group I or II intron splicing stimulation in vitro or in vivo. The four DEAD-box proteins that stimulate group I and II intron splicing unwind RNA duplexes by local strand separation and have little or no specificity, as judged by RNA-binding assays and stimulation of their ATPase activity by diverse RNAs. By contrast, DbpA binds group I and II intron RNAs non-specifically, but its ATPase activity is activated specifically by a helical segment of E. coli 23S rRNA, and NPH-II unwinds RNAs by directional translocation. The ability of DEAD-box proteins to stimulate group I and II intron splicing correlates primarily with their RNA-unwinding activity, which for the protein preparations used here was greatest for Mss116p, followed by Ded1p, CYT-19, and SrmB. Further, this correlation holds for all group I and II intron RNAs tested, implying a fundamentally similar mechanism for both types of introns. Our results support the hypothesis that DEAD-box proteins have an inherent ability to function as RNA chaperones by virtue of their distinctive RNA-unwinding mechanism, which enables refolding of localized RNA regions or structures without globally disrupting RNA structure.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19393667 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Del Campo M, Mohr S, Jiang Y, Jia H, Jankowsky E, Lambowitz AM</author>\n    <category>J Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19393667</guid>\n</item>	29	1240924243

In the absence of the chaperone, the folding of monellin occurs via three parallel routes. When folding is initiated in the presence of a saturating concentration of GroEL, only 50-60 % of the monellin molecules fold completely. The remaining 40-50 % of the monellin molecules remain bound to the GroEL, and are released only upon addition of ATP. It is shown that the basic folding mechanism of monellin is not altered by the presence of GroEL, but that when folding is initiated in the presence of saturating concentrations of GroEL, it occurs via only one of the three available routes. Two pathways become non-operational because GroEL binds very tightly to the early intermediates that populate these pathways, in a manner that makes the GroEL-bound intermediates incompetent to fold. This accounts for the monellin molecules that remain GroEL-bound at the end of the folding reaction. The third pathway remains operational because the GroEL-bound early intermediate on this pathway is folding-competent, suggesting that this early intermediate binds to GroEL in a manner that is different from that of the binding of the early intermediates on the other two pathways. It appears therefore that the same protein can bind GroEL in more than one way. The modulation of the folding energy landscape of monellin by GroEL occurs because GroEL binds folding intermediates on parallel folding pathways, in different ways, and with different affinities. Moreover, when GroEL is added to refolding monellin, at different times after commencement of refolding, the unfolding of two late kinetic intermediates on two of the three folding pathways can be observed. It appears that the unfolding of the late folding intermediates is enabled by a thermodynamic coupling mechanism, wherein GroEL binds more tightly to an early intermediate than to a late intermediate on a folding pathway, with the preferential binding energy being larger than the stability of the late intermediate. Hence, it is shown that GroEL can inadvertently and passively cause, through its ability to bind different folding intermediates differentially, the unfolding of late productive intermediates on folding pathways, and that its unfolding action is not restricted solely to misfolded or kinetically trapped intermediates.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19393665 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Patra AK, Udgaonkar JB</author>\n    <category>J Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19393665</guid>\n</item>	32	1240924243

The ability of DEAD-box proteins to stimulate group I and II intron splicing correlates primarily with their RNA-unwinding activity, which for the protein preparations used here was greatest for Mss116p, followed by Ded1p, CYT-19, and SrmB. Further, this correlation holds for all group I and II intron RNAs tested, implying a fundamentally similar mechanism for both types of introns. Our results support the hypothesis that DEAD-box proteins have an inherent ability to function as RNA chaperones by virtue of their distinctive RNA-unwinding mechanism, which enables refolding of localized RNA regions or structures without globally disrupting RNA structure.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19393667 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Del Campo M, Mohr S, Jiang Y, Jia H, Jankowsky E, Lambowitz AM</author>\n    <category>J Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19393667</guid>\n</item>	29	1240925583

It acts as an entomotoxic factor against major insect pests in stored crops and vegetables, making it a promising bioinsecticide. Here we report an efficient and simple protocol for the production of large quantities of highly pure, biologically active synthetic PA1b. The features of PA1b oxidative refolding revealed off-pathway products and competitive aggregation processes. The efficiency of the oxidative folding can be significantly improved by using hydrophobic alcoholic co-solvents and decreasing the temperature. The homogeneity of the synthetic oxidized PA1b was established by reversed-phase HPLC. The correct pairing of the three disulfide bridges, as well as the three-dimensional structure of synthetic PA1b were assessed by NMR. Synthetic PA1b binds to microsomal proteins from Sitophilus oryzae with a Kd of 8 nM, a figure quite similar to that determined for PA1b extracted from its natural source. Moreover, the synthetic miniprotein was as potent as the extracted one towards the sensitive strains of weevils. Our findings will open the way to the production of PA1b analogues by chemical means to an in-depth understanding of the PA1b mechanism of action. (c) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The features of PA1b oxidative refolding revealed off-pathway products and competitive aggregation processes. The efficiency of the oxidative folding can be significantly improved by using hydrophobic alcoholic co-solvents and decreasing the temperature. The homogeneity of the synthetic oxidized PA1b was established by reversed-phase HPLC. The correct pairing of the three disulfide bridges, as well as the three-dimensional structure of synthetic PA1b were assessed by NMR. Synthetic PA1b binds to microsomal proteins from Sitophilus oryzae with a Kd of 8 nM, a figure quite similar to that determined for PA1b extracted from its natural source. Moreover, the synthetic miniprotein was as potent as the extracted one towards the sensitive strains of weevils.

GSH was continuously oxidized into glutathione disulfide (GSSG) as incubation period increased at the temperatures ranging from 10 to 50 degrees C while certain oxidation by-products were also observed at the later stage of reaction at higher temperatures (70-90 degrees C). The addition of 0.3 mM GSSG in 3 mM GSH solution delayed the onset of GSH oxidation without significantly changing the rate of GSH oxidation. Our results also revealed that GSH oxidation could be facilitated upon the addition of copper (II) ion whereas GSH oxidation was found to be decelerated when EDTA was present. In kinetic analysis, the reaction orders of GSH oxidation under various conditions were determined. Moreover, the temperature dependence of the rate of GSH oxidation was modeled by Arrhenius and Eyring equations and resultant activation parameters were also presented.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19404681 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Wang SS, Hung YT, Lin YC</author>\n    <category>Bioprocess Biosyst Eng</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19404681</guid>\n</item>	1	1242821254

Here we demonstrate a novel combination of electromagnetic tweezers and evanescent nanometry that readily captures the forced unfolding trajectories of protein L at pulling forces as low as 10-15 pN. Using this approach, we monitor unfolding and refolding cycles of the same polyprotein for a period of time longer than 30 min.

The high AFP expression yields in the form of inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli renders the inclusion body route potentially advantageous for process scale commercial manufacture, if high-throughput refolding can be achieved. This study reports the successful development of an 'anion-exchange chromatography'-based refolding process for recombinant human AFP (rhAFP), which carries the challenges of contaminant spectrum and molecule complexity. rhAFP was readily refolded on-column at rhAFP concentrations unachievable with dilution refolding due to viscosity and solubility constraints. DEAE-FF functioned as a refolding enhancer to achieve rhAFP refolding yield of 28% and product purity of 95% in 3h, at 1mg/ml protein refolding concentration. Optimization of both refolding and chromatography column operation parameters (i.e. resin chemistry, column geometry, redox potential and feed conditioning) significantly improved rhAFP refolding efficiency. Compared to dilution refolding, on-column rhAFP refolding productivity was 9-fold higher, while that of off-column refolding was more than an order of magnitude higher. Successful demonstration that a simple anion-exchange column can, in a single step, readily refold and purify semi-crude rhAFP comprising 16 disulfide bonds, will certainly extend the application of column refolding to a myriad of complex industrial inclusion body proteins.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19419725 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Chen Y, Leong SS</author>\n    <category>J Chromatogr A</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19419725</guid>\n</item>	5	1241787864

Many cellular forces, e.g. those generated in cyclic conformational changes of biological machines, have repetitive components. In apparent contrast, little is known about how dynamic protein structures respond to periodic mechanical information. Ubiquitin is a small protein found in all eukaryotes. We developed molecular dynamics simulations to unfold single and multimeric ubiquitins with periodic forces. By using a coarse-grained representation we were able to model forces with periods about two orders of magnitude longer than the protein's relaxation time. We found that even a moderate periodic force weakened the protein and shifted its unfolding pathways in a frequency-and amplitude-dependent manner. A complex dynamic response with secondary structure refolding and an increasing importance of local interactions was revealed. Importantly, repetitive forces with broadly distributed frequencies elicited very similar molecular responses compared to fixed-frequency forces. When testing the influence of pulling geometry on ubiquitin's mechanical stability, it was found that the linkage involved in the mechanical degradation of cellular proteins renders the protein remarkably insensitive to periodic forces. We also devised a complementary kinetic energy landscape model that traces these observations and explains periodic force single-molecule measurements.

Its active form has a lethal activity against specific mosquito larvae. We characterized an unfolding pathway of Cyt2Aa2 using a guanidinium hydrochloride denaturation. The results revealed three-state transition with a detectable intermediate in a condition with 3-4M of GuHCl. The conformational free energies for native and intermediate state unfolding were 5.82+/-0.47 and 16.85+/-1.47kcal/mol, respectively. Kinetic analysis suggested that the activation energy of both transitions was around 23-25kcal/mol, with a rate-limiting step in the second transition. These results have established an energy profile of the Cyt2Aa2 toxin in various conformations involved in the unfolding/refolding pathway. Further characterization of the intermediate state by dye-binding assay, intrinsic fluorescence, and circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrated characteristics of a molten globule state.

The molecule has five disulfide bonds and hence, is a challenge to refold. Variables studied included pH, dithiothreitol (DTT) concentration, cystine concentration, urea concentration, protein concentration, dissolution hold time, and oxygen availability. In view of the complexity of the reaction with respect to the number of parameters that can impact the refold efficiency, some variables were examined via single parameter studies while others were looked at via Design of experiments (DOE). The DOE approach allowed us to look at the effect of these variables in wide ranges as well as their interactions in a very efficient manner. We were able to obtain a maximal refolding efficiency of 57%, defined as a % of correctly folded, bioactive dimer protein from inclusion body slurries produced from E. coli. The final method involved dissolution of inclusion bodies for 30 min. at 2 mg/mL protein, 6M urea, 2 mM DTT, 50 mM Tris, pH 10.2 for approximately 30 min., followed by addition of 4 mM cystine just prior to a 10-fold dilution with 50 mM Tris, pH 10.2 buffer and reaction for 72 hr. at 2-10 degrees C. The use of DOE allowed us to understand the interactions between the various parameters, in particular between cystine and urea concentrations.

J. 2009, 5, 674-683Controlled shear affinity filtration (CSAF) is an integrated bioprocess that positions a contoured rotor above a membrane affinity chromatography column to purify a secreted protein product directly from cell culture, e.g. monoclonal antibodies. However, for industrial application an effective method for scale-up is needed. To achieve this Francis and Haynes from Vancouver (Canada) used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to determine fluid hydrodynamics and expected filter performance for CSAF units with increasing size. This resulted in an in silico design of a preparative CSAF device, which allows processing of 1000 L cell culture in two hours. In addition, the authors report a method for the parallelization of CSAF units that can be applied to volumes exceeding 1000 L.

J. 2009, 5, 712-721Gas/solid biocatalysis has various potential applications, including fine chemical synthesis and toxic pollutant degradation. To gain a deeper insight into the enzyme microenvironment of a gas/solid system, researchers from Aachen and J&#xFC;lich (Germany) studied the adsorption of water and substrates to dry deposited alcohol dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus brevis. To monitor the system the well-characterized conversion of acetophenone catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase was chosen. While acetophenone is adsorbed to the deposited enzyme preparation at a significant level, comparable to the amount of adsorbed water, 2-propanol was not adsorbed at a detectable level. Reaction kinetics will to be studied in the future. INCLUSION BODIES RESOLVED: D&#xFC;rauer, et al., Biotechnol. J. 2009, 5, 722-729Recombinant proteins produced in Escherichia coli are often deposited in so-called inclusion bodies (IBs). The purification of proteins in IBs requires several steps, including solubilization and refolding of non-native proteins. Researchers from Vienna (Austria) report a new method for high-throughput screening of solubilization conditions and evaluation of dissolution kinetics carried out in conventional 96-well plates. This involves simple measurements of absorbance at 600 nm and 280 nm to determine turbidity and protein concentration. This new method will contribute to a faster development in the early stage of recombinant protein recovery from E. coli.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19452456 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author/>\n    <category>Biotechnol J</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19452456</guid>\n</item>	0	1244527374

Eukaryotic gene expression is often regulated by a mechanism of combinatorial control that involves the binding of dimeric transcription factors to DNA together with the coordinated activity of additional proteins. In this study, we investigated the dimerization of the Arc-repressor on DNA with the aim of achieving microscopic insight into the possible advantages of interacting with DNA as a complex rather than as a monomeric single-domain protein. We used a computational coarse-grained model in which the protein dynamics was governed by native interactions and protein-DNA interactions were dictated by electrostatic forces. Inspired by previous experimental work that showed an enhanced refolding rate for the Arc-repressor in the presence of DNA and other polyanions, we focused on the mechanism and kinetics of the assembly of Arc monomers in the presence of single- (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecules in a low-salt concentration environment. The electrostatic interactions that attract the protein to the dsDNA were shown to be fundamental in colocalizing the unfolded Arc chains and in accelerating refolding. Arc monomers bind the dsDNA efficiently and nonspecifically, and search for each other via one-dimensional diffusion. The fastest folding of Arc is observed for DNA of 30 bp. Longer DNA is significantly less efficient in accelerating the Arc refolding rate, since the two subunits search distinct regions of the one-dimensional DNA and are therefore much less colocalized. The probability that the two unfolded chains will meet on 200 bp DNA is similar to that in the bulk. The colocalization of Arc subunits on ssDNA results in much faster folding compared to that obtained on dsDNA of the same length. Differences in the rate of Arc refolding, cooperativity, and the structure of its transition state ensemble introduced by ssDNA and dsDNA molecules demonstrate the important role of colocalization in biological self-assembly processes.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19450491 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Marcovitz A, Levy Y</author>\n    <category>Biophys J</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19450491</guid>\n</item>	11	1244550446

They are formed from the natural refolding of water-soluble fibroins with alpha-helical and random coil structures in silk glands into insoluble fibers with mainly beta-structures. The structures of the fibroins at atomic resolution and silk formation mechanism remain largely unknown. Here, we report the 3D structures of individual domains of a approximately 366-kDa eggcase silk protein that consists of 20 identical type 1 repetitive domains, one type 2 repetitive domain, and conserved nonrepetitive N- and C-terminal domains. The structures of the individual domains in solution were determined by using NMR techniques. The domain interactions were investigated by NMR and dynamic light-scattering techniques. The formation of micelles and macroscopic fibers from the domains was examined by electron microscopy. We find that either of the terminal domains covalently linked with at least one repetitive domain spontaneously forms micelle-like structures and can be further transformed into fibers at &gt;/=37 degrees C and a protein concentration of &gt;0.1 wt%. Our biophysical and biochemical experiments indicate that the less hydrophilic terminal domains initiate the assembly of the proteins and form the outer layer of the micelles whereas the more hydrophilic repetitive domains are embedded inside to ensure the formation of the micelle-like structures that are the essential intermediates in silk formation. Our results establish the roles of individual silk protein domains in fiber formation and provide the basis for designing miniature fibroins for producing artificial silks.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19458259 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Lin Z, Huang W, Zhang J, Fan JS, Yang D</author>\n    <category>Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19458259</guid>\n</item>	0	1244696982

Their function is poorly understood, but they have been implicated in cell division, proliferation, and growth, as well as several medical conditions. Individual subfamilies within the G-protein superfamily possess unique nucleotide binding and hydrolysis rates that are intrinsic to their cellular function, and so characterization of these rates for a particular G-protein may provide insight into its cellular activity. We have produced recombinant active DRG protein using a bacterial expression system and refolding, and performed biochemical characterization of their GTP binding and hydrolysis. We show that recombinant Arabidopsis thaliana atDRG1 and atDRG2a are able to bind GDP and GTP. We also show that DRGs can hydrolyze GTP in vitro without the assistance of GTPase-activating proteins and guanine exchange factors. The atDRG proteins hydrolyze GTP at a relatively slow rate (0.94 x 10(-3) min(-1) for DRG1 and 1.36 x 10(-3) min(-1) for DRG2) that is consistent with their nearest characterized relatives, the Obg subfamily. The ability of DRGs to bind nucleotide substrates without assistance, their slow rate of GTP hydrolysis, heat stress activation and domain conservation suggest a possible role as a chaperone in ribosome assembly in response to stress as it has been suggested for the Obg proteins, a different but related G-protein subfamily.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19460440 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> O'Connell A, Robin G, Kobe B, Botella JR</author>\n    <category>Protein Expr Purif</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19460440</guid>\n</item>	3	1244750698

These recombinant enzymes were denatured by Gdn-HCl and refolded by rapid dilution in the presence of L-Arg, NADP(+) and DTT at 25 (o)C. The refolding yields of the mutants exhibited strong NADP(+)- dependence and ranged from 1.5% to 59.4% with 1000 microM NADP(+), in all cases lower than the figure of 72% for the wild-type enzyme. These mutant enzymes also displayed decreased thermostability and high susceptibility to chymotrypsin digestion, in good agreement with their corresponding melting temperatures in CD experiments. Taken together, the results support the view that impaired binding of "structural" NADP(+) can hinder folding as well as causing instability of these clinical mutant enzymes in the fully folded state.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19465117 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Wang XT, Engel PC</author>\n    <category>Biochim Biophys Acta</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19465117</guid>\n</item>	44	1244750698

Some members have chaperone-like activities and/or play a role in cytoskeletal stabilization. Some members also show a dynamic, stress-induced translocation to SC35 splicing speckles. If and how these features are interrelated and if they are shared by all members is yet unknown. METHODS: Tissue expression data and interaction and co-regulated gene expression data of the human HSPB members was analysed using bioinformatics. Using a gene expression library, sub-cellular distribution of the diverse members was analyzed by confocal microscopy. Chaperone activity was measured using a cellular luciferase refolding assay. RESULTS: Online databases did not accurately predict the sub-cellular distribution of all the HSPB members. A novel and non-predicted finding was that HSPB7 constitutively localized to SC35 splicing speckles, driven by its N-terminus. Unlike HSPB1 and HSPB5, that chaperoned heat unfolded substrates and kept them folding competent, HSPB7 did not support refolding. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a non-chaperone-like role of HSPB7 at SC35 speckles. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The functional divergence between HSPB members seems larger than previously expected and also includes non-canonical members lacking classical chaperone-like functions.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19464326 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Vos MJ, Kanon B, Kampinga HH</author>\n    <category>Biochim Biophys Acta</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19464326</guid>\n</item>	1	1244750698

Identification of mutations that prevent the aggregation of unfolded proteins provides insights into folding pathways. In a lipase from Bacillus subtilis, evolved by directed evolution procedures, the irreversibility due to temperature-mediated aggregation was completely prevented by a single mutation, M137P. Though the parent and the mutants unfold completely on heating, mutants having substitutions M137P, along with M134E and S163P, completely or partially prevent the formation of aggregation-prone intermediate(s) at 75 degrees C. The three mutants show only a marginal increase in free energy of unfolding (DeltaG(H(2)O)), however, the profiles of the residual activity with temperature shows remarkable shift to higher temperature compared to parent. The intermediate(s) were characterized by enhanced binding of bis-ANS, a probe to titrate surface hydrophobicity, aggregation profiles and by estimation of soluble protein. Inclusion of salt in the refolding conditions prevents the reversibility of mutant having charge substitution, while the reversibility of mutant with the introduction of proline was unaffected, indicating the role of charge mediated interaction in M134E in preventing aggregation. Partial prevention of thermal aggregation in wild-type lipase with single substitution, M137P, incorporated by site-directed mutagenesis, suggests that the affect of M137P is independent of the intrinsic thermostability of lipase. Various effects of the mutations suggest their role is in prevention of the formation of aggregation prone intermediate(s). These mutations, describe yet another strategy to enhance the thermotolerance of proteins, where their influence is observed only on the denatured ensemble.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19472328 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Ahmad S, Rao NM</author>\n    <category>Protein Sci</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19472328</guid>\n</item>	1	1244745675

This work describes the use of a continuous monitoring system for a protein refolding reaction to provide consistency in product quality and process performance across batches. A small-scale bioreactor (3 L) is used to understand the impact of aeration for refolding recombinant human vascular endothelial growth factor (rhVEGF) in a reducing environment. A reverse-phase HPLC assay is used to assess product quality. The goal in understanding the oxygen needs of the reaction and its impact to quality, is to make a product that is efficiently refolded to its native and active form with minimum oxidative degradation from batch to batch. Because this refolding process is heavily dependent on oxygen, the % dissolved oxygen (DO) profile is explored as a PAT tool to regulate process performance at commercial manufacturing scale. A dynamic gassing out approach using constant mass transfer (k(L)a) is used for scale-up of the aeration parameters to manufacturing scale tanks (2,000 L, 15,000 L). The resulting DO profiles of the refolding reaction show similar trends across scales and these are analyzed using rpHPLC. The desired product quality attributes are then achieved through alternating air and nitrogen sparging triggered by changes in the monitored DO profile. This approach mitigates the impact of differences in equipment or feedstock components between runs, and is directly inline with the key goal of PAT to "actively manage process variability using a knowledge-based approach."

After secretion in plasma, length is regulated by hydrodynamic shear force-dependent unfolding of the A2 domain, which is then cleaved by a specific protease. The 1.9-A crystal structure of the A2 domain demonstrates evolutionary adaptations to this shear sensor function. Unique among VWF A (VWA) domains, A2 contains a loop in place of the alpha4 helix, and a cis-proline. The central beta4-strand is poorly packed, with multiple side-chain rotamers. The Tyr-Met cleavage site is buried in the beta4-strand in the central hydrophobic core, and the Tyr structurally links to the C-terminal alpha6-helix. The alpha6-helix ends in 2 Cys residues that are linked by an unusual vicinal disulfide bond that is buried in a hydrophobic pocket. These features may narrow the force range over which unfolding occurs and may also slow refolding. Von Willebrand disease mutations, which presumably lower the force at which A2 unfolds, are illuminated by the structure.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19470641 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Zhang Q, Zhou YF, Zhang CZ, Zhang X, Lu C, Springer TA</author>\n    <category>Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19470641</guid>\n</item>	14	1245135901

Hexahistidine-tagged enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and refolded and purified from urea-solubilized inclusion bodies by the strategy. The artificial chaperone system was composed of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD). In the refolding process, denatured protein was mixed with CTAB to form a protein-CTAB complex. The mixture was then loaded to IMAC column and the complex was bound via metal chelating to the histidine tag. This was followed by washing with a refolding buffer containing beta-CD that removed CTAB from the bound protein and initiated on-column refolding. The effect of the washing time (i.e., on-column refolding time) on mass and fluorescence recoveries was examined. Extensive studies by comparison with other related refolding techniques have proved the advantages of AC-IMAC. In the on-column refolding, the artificial chaperone system suppressed protein interactions and facilitated protein folding to its native structure. So, the on-column refolding by AC-IMAC led to 99% pure EGFP with a fluorescence recovery of 80%. By comparison at a similar final EGFP concentration (0.6-0.8mg/mL), this fluorescence recovery value was not only much higher than direct dilution (14%) and AC-assisted refolding (26%) in bulk solutions, but also superior to its partner, IMAC (60%). The operating conditions would be further optimized to improve the refolding efficiency.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19473661 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Dong XY, Chen LJ, Sun Y</author>\n    <category>J Chromatogr A</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19473661</guid>\n</item>	20	1245222326

The azobenzene-based surfactant photoisomerizes upon 434 nm visible (trans, relatively hydrophobic) and 350 nm UV (cis, relatively hydrophilic) illumination, allowing surfactant micellization to be reversibly controlled. This leads to partitioning of the membrane protein into micelles in the unfolded state under visible light, while UV light leads to solubilization of the protein within purple membrane bilayers in the folded state. A three-stage model of purple membrane-photosurfactant interactions is examined through NMR and DLS measurements. Phototriggered unfolding of bacteriorhodopsin, occurring through alpha(II) --&gt; alpha(I) and reverse beta-turn --&gt; extended beta-strand transitions, requires approximately 20 s for completion, while light-induced refolding requires a somewhat longer 80 s as the membrane protein repartitions into the reformed bilayer membrane. Each of these conformational changes can be precisely and reversibly controlled with simple light illumination, providing a novel technique to probe membrane protein folding.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19485396 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Zhang J, Wang SC, Lee CT</author>\n    <category>J Phys Chem B</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19485396</guid>\n</item>	70	1245835088

Drug delivery systems with tumor-targeting potential are highly desired for improving the efficacy and applicability of these drugs. This study describes an alternative strategy for the delivery of platinum drugs (cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin) by encapsulating each of them in the cavity of apoferritin (AFt). The encapsulation was achieved through manipulating the pH-dependent unfolding-refolding process of AFt at pH 2.0 and 7.4, respectively, in saturated drug solution. UV-vis spectrometry, circular dichroism spectrometry, dynamic light scattering, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry were used to characterize the AFt-drug complexes. The loading capacity of AFt varies with respective drugs and the structural integrity of the protein shell remains intact after encapsulation. In vitro assays on the rat pheochromocytoma cell line (PC12) show that AFt-cisplatin inhibits the cells in a slow but sustaining mode and the cellular uptake of platinum is enhanced by AFt. AFt-carboplatin and AFt-oxaliplatin complexes only exhibit a marginal cytotoxicity towards this cell line under similar concentrations.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19501911 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Xing R, Wang X, Zhang C, Zhang Y, Wang Q, Yang Z, Guo Z</author>\n    <category>J Inorg Biochem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19501911</guid>\n</item>	8	1245924341

Refolded protein was purified with DEAE anion exchange chromatography using both radial and axial flow column (50 ml bed volume each). Higher buffer flow rate (30 ml/min) in radial flow column helped in reducing the batch processing time for purification of refolded r-hGH. Radial column based purification resulted in high throughput recovery of diluted refolded r-hGH in comparison to axial column. More than 40 % of inclusion body protein could be refolded into bioactive form using the above method in a single batch.

Its structure, typically spanning 150 residues, has three tiers; a basal layer of two or more alpha-helices, a middle layer of beta-pleated sheet and a top layer formed by segments of the polypeptide that connect strands of the beta-sheet. In structures of GAF domains in complex with their effectors, these polypeptide segments envelop the ligand enclosing it in a cavity whose base is formed by the beta-sheet, so that ligand binding and release must be accompanied by conformational rearrangements of the distal portion of the structure. Descriptions of binding are presently limited by the absence of a GAF domain for which both liganded and unliganded structures are known. Earlier, we solved the crystal structure of the GAF domain of CodY, a branched chain amino acid and GTP responsive regulator of the transcription of stationary phase and virulence genes in Bacillus, in complexes with isoleucine and valine. Here, we report the structure of this domain in its unliganded form, allowing definition of the structural changes accompanying ligand binding. The core of the protein and its dimerisation interface are essentially unchanged in agreement with circular dichroism spectroscopy experiments that show that the secondary structure composition is unperturbed by ligand binding. There is however, extensive refolding of the binding site loops, with up to 15 A movements of the coiled segment linking beta3 and beta4, such that in the absence of the ligand, the binding pocket is not formed. The implications of these structural rearrangements for ligand affinity and specificity are discussed. Finally, saturation transfer difference NMR spectroscopy showed binding of isoleucine, but not GTP, to the GAF domain suggesting that the two cofactors do not have a common binding site.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19500589 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Levdikov VM, Blagova E, Colledge VL, Lebedev AA, Williamson DC, Sonenshein AL, Wilkinson AJ</author>\n    <category>J Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19500589</guid>\n</item>	6	1246100749

Refolding conditions for its in vitro activation - including incorporation of heme and structural Ca[2+] ions, and formation of disulfide bridges - were optimized taking as a starting point those reported for other plant and fungal peroxidases. The absorption spectrum of the refolded enzyme was identical to that of wild LiP from T. cervina suggesting that it was properly folded. The enzyme was able to oxidize 1,4-dimethoxybenzene and ferrocytochrome c confirming its high redox potential and ability to oxidize large substrates. However, during oxidation of veratryl alcohol (VA), the physiological LiP substrate, an unexpected initial lag period was observed. Possible modification of the enzyme was investigated by incubating it with H(2)O(2) and VA (for 30 min before dialysis). The pretreated enzyme showed normal kinetics traces for VA oxidation, without the initial lag previously observed. Steady-state kinetics of the pretreated LiP were almost the same as the recombinant enzyme before the pretreatment. Moreover, the catalytic constant (k(cat)) for VA oxidation was comparable to that of wild LiP fromT. cervina, although the Michaelis-Menten constant (K(m)) was eight-fold higher. The present heterologous expression system provides a valuable tool to investigate structure-function relationships, and autocatalytic activation of the unique T. cervina LiP.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19505579 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Miki Y, Morales MA, Ruiz-DueÃ±as FJ, MartÄ± Nez MA, Wariishi H, MartÄ± Nez AT</author>\n    <category>Protein Expr Purif</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19505579</guid>\n</item>	25	1246363564

Solution additives are mainly grouped into two classes, i.e., protein denaturants and stabilizers. The former includes guanidine, urea, strong ionic detergents, and certain chaotropic salts; the latter includes certain amino acids, sugars, polyhydric alcohols, osmolytes, and kosmotropic salts. However, there are solution additives that are not unambiguously placed into these two classes, including arginine, certain divalent cation salts (e.g., MgCl(2)) and certain polyhydric alcohols (e.g., ethylene glycol). Certain non-ionic or non-detergent surfactants, ionic liquids, amino acid derivatives, polyamines, and certain amphiphilic polymers may belong to this class. They have marginal effects on protein structure and stability, but are able to disrupt protein interactions.

The antigen-binding site of these unusual heavy chain antibodies (hcAbs) is formed only by a single domain, designated VHH in camelid hcAbs and VNAR in shark hcAbs. VHH and VNAR are easily produced as recombinant proteins, designated single domain antibodies (sdAbs) or nanobodies. The CDR3 region of these sdAbs possesses the extraordinary capacity to form long fingerlike extensions that can extend into cavities on antigens, e.g., the active site crevice of enzymes. Other advantageous features of nanobodies include their small size, high solubility, thermal stability, refolding capacity, and good tissue penetration in vivo.

Here we studied the refolding of GdnCl denatured TSC from its molten globule state (TSC-m complex) in the presence and absence of alpha-crystallin to elucidate the molecular mechanism of chaperone-mediated in vitro folding. Our results, based on intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and ANS binding studies, suggest that alpha-crystallin formed a complex with a putative intermediate molten globule - like intermediate in the refolding pathway of TSC.

Yeast prions possess domains enriched in glutamines and asparagines that act as templates to drive the assembly of native proteins into beta-sheet-rich, amyloid-like fibrils. Several recent studies highlight a significant and complex function for Hsp40 co-chaperones in propagation of prion elements in yeast. Hsp40 co-chaperones bind non-native polypeptides and transfer these clients to Hsp70s for refolding or degradation. How Hsp40 co-chaperones bind amyloid-like prion conformers that are enriched in hydrophilic residues such as glutamines and asparagines is a significant question in the field. Interestingly, selective recognition of amyloid-like conformers by distinct Hsp40s appears to confer opposing actions on prion assembly. For example, the Type I Hsp40 Ydj1 and Type II Hsp40 Sis1 bind different regions within the prion protein Rnq1 and function respectively to inhibit or promote [RNQ(+)] prion assembly. Thus, substrate selectivity enables distinct Hsp40s to act at unique steps in prion propagation.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19535913 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Summers DW, Douglas PM, Cyr DM</author>\n    <category>Prion</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19535913</guid>\n</item>	5	1249110924

Therefore, activation of this signaling pathway may improve the ability of many cells to be transplanted. We constructed a constitutively activated form of Met (Tpr-Met) fused to the protein transduction domain of HIV-TAT to activate the HGF/Met pathway for a few hours following cell injection. Matrix-assisted refolding was used to renature TAT-Tpr-Met protein, which was efficiently delivered into cells and recapitulated several biological functions of Met in vitro. Furthermore, treatment of hepatic progenitors with this molecule for one hour before transplantation significantly improved engraftment efficiency (31 % untreated cells, 58 % treated cells).

Knowledge about how immune responses are acquired against polymorphic DBL domains of PfEMP-1 can aid in the development of vaccines for malaria. A recombinant DBLalpha domain from R29var1, which binds complement receptor-1 to mediate rosetting by the P. falciparum laboratory strain R29, was expressed in Escherichia coli, renatured by oxidative refolding to its native form and purified to homogeneity. Antibody levels in 704 plasmas obtained from residents of areas of different malaria endemicity in Orissa (India) and Manhi&#xE7;a (Mozambique) were assessed by ELISA. Refolded DBLalpha was pure, homogeneous and functional in that it binds human erythrocytes with specificity and is capable of inhibiting rosetting. Proportion of individuals who had measurable anti-DBLalpha IgG responses was low in areas of low malaria endemicity from Orissa (6.7%), but high in areas of high endemicity from Orissa (87.5%) and Manhi&#xE7;a (74.5%). Seroprevalence and antibody levels against the recombinant protein increased with age of inhabitants from high transmission areas (p&lt;0.001). Half of the children in these areas had seroconverted by the age of five years. These findings suggest that, in spite of the extreme polymorphism of PfEMP1-DBLalpha domains, acquisition of specific antibodies is rapid, age-related, and reflects the reduced risk of malaria in high transmission areas.

Molecular chaperones of the Hsp40 family (Escherichia coli DnaJ homologs) recognize misfolded disease proteins and suppress the accumulation of toxic protein species. Type I Hsp40s are very potent at suppressing protein aggregation and facilitating the refolding of damaged proteins. Yet, the molecular mechanism for the recognition of nonnative polypeptides by Type I Hsp40s such as yeast Ydj1 is not clear. Here we computationally identify a unique motif that is selectively recognized by Ydj1p. The motif is characterized by the consensus sequence GX[LMQ]{P}X{P}{CIMPVW}, where [XY] denotes either X or Y and {XY} denotes neither X nor Y. We further verify the validity of the motif by site-directed mutagenesis and show that substrate binding by Ydj1 requires recognition of this motif. A yeast proteome screen revealed that many proteins contain more than one stretch of residues that contain the motif and are separated by varying numbers of amino acids. In light of our results, we propose a 2-site peptide-binding model and a plausible mechanism of peptide presentation by Ydj1p to the chaperones of the Hsp70 family. Based on our results, and given that Ydj1p and its human ortholog Hdj2 are functionally interchangeable, we hypothesize that our results can be extended to understanding human diseases.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19549854 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Kota P, Summers DW, Ren HY, Cyr DM, Dokholyan NV</author>\n    <category>Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19549854</guid>\n</item>	32	1249473534

We have designed tris(N-salicylideneaniline)-based hyperbranched molecules that spontaneously collapse to compact three-blade propeller geometry of either (P)- or (M)-handedness. For a homologous series of compounds, a direct correlation was established between the absolute screw sense, either (P)- or (M)-, of this helical folding and the absolute configuration, either (R)- or (S)-, of the chiral alcohol groups introducing local asymmetric bias to the conformationally restricted molecular backbone. 1H NMR and CD spectroscopic studies provided significant insights into structural folding and unfolding of these chiral molecules in solution, which proceed via reversible assembly and disassembly of the C3-symmetric hydrogen-bonding network. Notably, solvents profoundly influenced this dynamic process. A strong correlation between the solvent donor number (DN) or solvent basicity (SB) parameters and the change in the Cotton effects pointed toward specific O-H...solvent interactions that drive structural unfolding and eventual refolding to apparently opposite helicity. This unusual chirality inversion process could also be induced by installation of chemical protecting groups that simulate specific solvent-solute interactions. Removal of this covalent mimic of the solvent shell restored the original screw sense of the parent molecule, thus establishing the feasibility of covalently triggered helicity inversion as a new mode of operation for chiroptical molecular switches.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19554697 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Jiang X, Lim YK, Zhang BJ, Opsitnick EA, Baik MH, Lee D</author>\n    <category>J Am Chem Soc</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19554697</guid>\n</item>	0	1249620346

The inclusion body was dissolved in 6 M guanidine-HCl and gradually refolded to the active enzyme through dilution of the denaturant. The purified recombinant enzyme consisted of four identical subunits with a molecular mass of about 110 kDa. NADP was preferred as a coenzyme over NAD for (S)-malate oxidation and, unlike MDHs from other sources, this enzyme readily catalyzed the oxidation of (2S,3S)-tartrate and (2S,3R)-tartrate. The tartrate oxidation activity was also observed in MDHs from the hyperthermophilic archaea Methanocaldococcus jannaschii and Archaeoglobus fulgidus, suggesting these hyperthermophilic MDHs loosely bind their substrates. The refolded A. pernix MDH was also crystallized, and the structure was determined at a resolution of 2.9 A. Its overall structure was similar to those of the M. jannaschii, Chloroflexus aurantiacus, Chlorobium vibrioforme and Cryptosporidium parvum [lactate dehydrogenase-like] MDHs with root-mean-square-deviation values between 1.4 and 2.1 A. Consistent with earlier reports, Ala at position 53 was responsible for coenzyme specificity, and the next residue, Arg, was important for NADP binding. Structural comparison revealed that the hyperthermostability of the A. pernix MDH is likely attributable to its smaller cavity volume and larger numbers of ion pairs and ion-pair networks, but the molecular strategy for thermostability may be specific for each enzyme.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19555779 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Kawakami R, Sakuraba H, Goda S, Tsuge H, Ohshima T</author>\n    <category>Biochim Biophys Acta</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19555779</guid>\n</item>	23	1249620345

No vaccine is currently available for the virus and treatment options are limited to the prophylactic treatment of at-risk infants with the mAb palivizumab (Synagis) and to therapeutic intervention with the nucleoside analog ribavirin (Rebetol). The clinical use of these agents is limited and a need exists for more effective treatment for the at-risk population. The merging of viral and cellular membranes is a crucial event in the hRSV life cycle that enables the virus to enter a host cell. The multistep fusion process is facilitated by the substantial refolding of a trimeric class I fusion protein (F protein), which is the main target of fusion inhibitors. Several small-molecule fusion inhibitors have been discovered, of which some have progressed significantly in the drug development process. BTA-9881 (Biota Holdings Ltd/MedImmune) and TMC-353121 (Johnson &amp; Johnson) are the most advanced of this drug class. In addition, progress has been made in the development of next-generation antibodies such as motavizumab (Numax; MedImmune).

An autosomal dominant cortical progressive cataract has been associated with a G18V mutation in human gammaS-crystallin. To investigate the molecular mechanism of this cataract and confirm the causative nature of the G18V mutation we examined resultant changes in conformation and stability. Human gammaS-crystallin cDNA was cloned into pET-20b(+) and the G18V mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Recombinant HgammaS-crystallins were expressed in E. coli and purified by ion-exchange and size-exclusion chromatography. By analytical ultracentrifugation wild type and mutant HgammaS-crystallin are monomers of about 21.95+/-0.21kDa and 20.89 +/- 0.18kDa respectively and have similar secondary structures by far-UV CD. In increasing levels of guanidinium hydrochloride (GuHCl), a sharp red shift in fluorescence lambdamax and increase in emission correlating with exposure of tryptophans to the protein surface is detected earlier in the mutant protein. Under thermal stress, the G18V mutant begins to denature above 42 degrees C while wild type HgammaS-crystallin is very stable with a Tm value of 75.5 degrees C. Equilibrium unfolding/refolding experiments as a function of GuHCl confirm the relative instability of the G18V mutant. Wild type HgammaS-crystallin exhibits a two-state transition and reversible refolding above 1.0M GuHCl, but the unfolding transition of mutant HgammaS-crystallin shows an intermediate state. The first transition (N&gt;I) shows a [GuHCl]1/2 of 0.5 M while the second transition (I&gt;U) has the same [GuHCl]1/2 as wild type HgammaS-crystallin, about 2.0 M. Our present study confirms the high stability of wild type HgammaS-crystallin and demonstrates that the G18V mutation destabilizes the protein towards heat and GuHCl induced unfolding. These biophysical characteristics are consistent with the progressive cataract formation seen in the family members carrying this mutation.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19558189 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Ma ZP, Piszczek G, Wingfield PT, Sergeev YV, Hejtmancik JF</author>\n    <category>Biochemistry</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19558189</guid>\n</item>	45	1250757512

A Gram-positive bacillus, M. leprae has not been cultured in vitro: it is known to grow only in humans, mice and nine-banded armadillos, and, even there it is an obligate intracellular pathogen. The bacterium must have become an obligate intracellular organism relatively recently, judging by the number of pseudogenes and substantial gene decay found in the genomic sequence. As a result of this, there have been differences in the determinati on of valid open reading frames (ORFs) from various research groups. de Souza et al. have applied proteomic techniques to sort out the confusion. The ORFs of all six reading frames at least 20 codons long were carefully examined as potential peptide sources by LTQ-LC-MS/MS. The authors found 1046 different proteins, confirming others' findings with tuberculosis, a similar bacterium.

And, if you don't release him, you may be missing a minimum of one node and two links in a critical neural network. In this particular example, I know you will have a misfiring neuron because the sample is purified presynaptic nerve terminals from the hippocampus. How do I know? Because the target was purified and characterized by proteomic procedures according to Abul-Husn et al., authors of this paper. They used a very selective way to purify the presynaptic proteins and validate the sample, they manually validated the system by reviewing the biochemistry and physiology publications on experimental protein-protein interactions, and they applied computational graph theory analysis. For good measure, they also checked the gene ontology. Final result: 50 new candidates not previously recognized as presynaptic were identified by shared neighbor analysis. SHOCKING BEHAVIOR: pp. 3383-3394The heat shock proteins (hsp) are a family of proteins that developed very early in evolution, appearing in all kingdoms. They play many roles in cells, ranging from protection against a variety of types of stress, directing proper refolding of partially denatured or newly synthesized proteins, to presentation of antigens. In this paper, Trott et al. use proteomic and genetic tools to examine the role of hsp27 in the growth of human endothelial and smooth muscle cells. More particularly, they work with hypo- and hyper-phosphorylated, and anti-sense knock out mutants engineered into adenovirus vectors. Findings observed on cultured cells were confirmed in vivo.

While theoretical data do not have the resolution necessary to observe details of the chromophore during refolding, experimental results point to the chromophore as the cause of the observed hysteresis. Using NMR spectroscopy, which probes at the level of the individual residue, the hysteretic intermediate state is further characterized in the context of the loosely-folded native-like state {N(iso)} predicted in simulation. In the present study, several residues located in the lid of GFP indicate heterogeneity of the native states. Some of these residues show chemical shifts when the native-like intermediate {N(iso)} responsible for GFP's hysteretic folding behavior is trapped. Observed changes in the chromophore are consistent with increased flexibility or isomerization in {N(iso)} as predicted in recent theoretical work. Here we observe multiple chromophore environments within the native state are averaged in the trapped intermediate, linking chromophore flexibility to mispacking in the trapped intermediate. The present work is experimental evidence for the proposed final "locking" mechanism in GFP folding forming an incorrectly or loosely packed barrel under intermediate (hysteretic) folding conditions.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19577576 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Andrews BT, Roy M, Jennings PA</author>\n    <category>J Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19577576</guid>\n</item>	0	1250939754

The refolding kinetics are probed by small-angle x-ray scattering, circular dichroism, and fluorescence to measure the radius of gyration, the average secondary structure content, and the native packing around the single tryptophan residue. The main resolved kinetic phase of the mutant is probe independent and faster than the main phase observed for the pseudo-wild-type. Excess helical structure formed early on by the mutant may reduce the formation of turns and prevent the formation of compact misfolded states, speeding up the overall folding process. Extrapolation of our main cryogenic folding phase and previous T-jump measurements to 37 degrees C yields nearly the same refolding rate as extrapolated by Oas and co-workers from NMR line-shape data.

Upon refolding, the autoprotease becomes active and cleaves itself specifically at its own C-terminus releasing the target protein with its authentic N-terminus. N(pro) wild-type and its mutant EDDIE, respectively, were fused N-terminally to the model proteins green fluorescent protein, staphylococcus Protein A domain D, inhibitory peptide of senescence-evasion-factor, and the short 16 amino acid peptide pep6His. In comparison with the N(pro) wild-type, the tailored mutant EDDIE displayed an increased rate constant for refolding and cleavage from 1.3 x 10(-4) s(-1) to 3.5 x 10(-4) s(-1), and allowed a 15-fold higher protein concentration of 1.1 mg/mL when studying pep6His as a fusion partner. For green fluorescent protein, the rate constant was increased from 2.4 x 10(-5) s(-1) to 1.1 x 10(-4) s(-1) when fused to EDDIE. When fused to small target peptides, refolding and cleavage yields were independent of initial protein concentration, even at high concentrations of 3.9 mg/mL, although cleavage rates were strongly influenced by the fusion partner. This behavior differed from conventional 1st order refolding kinetics, where yield strongly depends on initial protein concentration due to an aggregation reaction of higher order. Refolding and cleavage of EDDIE fusion proteins follow a monomolecular reaction for the autoproteolytic cleavage over a wide concentration range. At high protein concentrations, deviations from the model assumptions were observed and thus smaller rate constants were required to approximate the data. Biotechnol. Bioeng.

It has been suggested that the partial unfolding of beta2-m is a prerequisite to the formation of amyloid fibrils, and that the folding intermediate trapped by the non-native trans-Pro32 isomer leads to the formation of amyloid fibrils. Although clarifying the structure of this refolding intermediate by high resolution NMR spectroscopy is important, this has been made difficult by the limited lifetime of the intermediate. Here, we studied the structure of the refolding intermediate using a combination of amino acid selective labeling with wheat germ cell-free protein synthesis and NMR techniques. The HSQC spectra of beta2-ms labeled selectively at either phenylalanine, leucine, or valine enabled us to monitor the structures of the refolding intermediate. The results suggested that the refolding intermediate has an overall fold and cores similar to the native structure, but contains disordered structures around Pro32. The fluctuation of the beta-sheet regions especially the last half of the betaB strand and the first half of the betaE strand, both suggested to be important for amyloidogenicity, may transform beta2-m into an amyloidogenic structure.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19606503 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Kameda A, Morita EH, Sakurai K, Naiki H, Goto Y</author>\n    <category>Protein Sci</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19606503</guid>\n</item>	0	1251362873

Our goal was to learn what the immune system "sees" on the surfaces of tumor cells by acid-eluting peptides from HLA molecules for extended time periods. We determined how long peptides would continue to elute over time from a pancreatic tumor cell line, Panc-1, and a breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, at pH 3.0 in citrate buffer while monitoring viability. Both cell lines demonstrated greater than 90% viability after 25min at pH 3.0. Panc-1 remained &gt;90% intact after 45min at pH 3.0. Acid eluted peptide sequences were identified using LC-MS/MS and searching the NCBI refseq database. The total number of peptides eluted peaked between 40 and 45min for Panc-1, but continued to increase over time from MCF-7. A total of 131 peptides were identified from Panc-1 while 101 peptides were identified from MCF-7 elutions. Two classes of peptides were eluted: (1) 8-10 amino acid peptides fitting the HLA-binding motifs of each cell line, and (2) peptides longer than 10 amino acids containing HLA-binding motifs of each cell line. W6/32 antibody affinity purification of intact MHC molecules after papain cleavage of MHC class I from tumor cell surfaces also indicated that peptides longer than 10 amino acids bind to class I proteins. A peptide-MHC-refolding assay further substantiated the binding of longer peptides to HLA-A*0201. Our findings provide sequences and gene names of peptides presented by MHC class I molecules from common pancreas and breast cancer cell lines. We utilized a novel refolding assay to demonstrate that peptides longer than the canonical 8-10 amino acids commonly bind in MHC class I cell surface molecules.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19615748 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Antwi K, Hanavan PD, Myers CE, Ruiz YW, Thompson EJ, Lake DF</author>\n    <category>Mol Immunol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19615748</guid>\n</item>	0	1251450536

Global and local structures of the Cu-MTs were subsequently characterized by anomalous small-angle x-ray scattering (ASAXS) and extended x-ray absorption fine structure. Energy-dependent ASAXS results indicate that the morphology of Cu(II)-MT resembles that of the native MT, whereas Cu(I)-MT forms oligomers with a higher copper content. Both dummy-residue simulation and model-shape fitting of the ASAXS data reveal consistently rodlike morphology for Cu(II)-MT. Clearly identified Cu-S, Cu-O, and Cu-Cu contributions in the extended x-ray absorption fine structure analysis indicate that both Cu(I) and Cu(II) ions are bonded with O and S atoms of nearby amino acids in a four-coordination environment, forming metal clusters smaller than metal thiolate clusters in the native MT.

Expression systems based on self-cleavable intein domains allow the generation of recombinant proteins with a C-terminal thioester, providing a unique handle for site-specific conjugation using native chemical ligation (NCL). However, current methods to generate antibody fragments with C-terminal thioesters require cumbersome refolding procedures, effectively preventing application of NCL for antibody-mediated targeting and molecular imaging. RESULTS: Targeting to the periplasm of E. coli allowed efficient production of correctly-folded single-domain antibody (sdAb)-intein fusions proteins. On column purification and 2-mercapthoethanesulfonic acid (MESNA)-induced cleavage yielded single-domain antibodies with a reactive C-terminal MESNA thioester in good yields. These thioester-functionalized single-domain antibodies allowed synthesis of immunomicelles via native chemical ligation in a single step. CONCLUSION: A novel procedure was developed to obtain soluble, well-folded single-domain antibodies with reactive C-terminal thioesters in good yields. These proteins are promising building blocks for the chemoselective functionalization via NCL of a broad range of nanoparticle scaffolds, including micelles, liposomes and dendrimers.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19619333 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Reulen SW, van Baal I, Raats JM, Merkx M</author>\n    <category>BMC Biotechnol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19619333</guid>\n</item>	5	1251540990

A crucial step in HIV gp41-mediated fusion is the refolding of the protein into a six-helix bundle along the N- and C-terminal coiled-coil domains. These domains have been targeted by peptide inhibitors that inhibit gp41-mediated fusion. One of these inhibitors, enfuvirtide, is the first such drug approved for therapy. More recently, clinical data suggest that the beneficial effects of enfuvirtide extend beyond virus suppression and are associated with certain resistance mutations in gp41. In this study we characterized the bystander apoptosis-inducing potential of mutants associated with increased CD4 counts that arise during enfuvirtide therapy. Whereas all mutant clones were reduced in both cell-to-cell fusion activity and apoptosis induction there was limited effect on virus infection or replication. The viruses were found to have apoptosis-inducing activity in the order WT &gt; V38M &gt; V38A &gt; G36D &gt; V38E, which correlated with cell-to-cell fusion but not infection. Interestingly, the level of resistance as determined by the IC(50) of enfuvirtide also correlated inversely with both cell fusion and apoptosis in that the most resistant Envs were the least fusogenic and pathogenic. This suggests the beneficial effects of enfuvirtide therapy beyond virus suppression may be mediated by selecting less pathogenic HIV isolates over time.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19619009 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Garg H, Joshi A, Blumenthal R</author>\n    <category>AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19619009</guid>\n</item>	40	1251779357

In methanol-OD, all active H's in the peptide exchange for D within 5 min, indicating a monomer/dimer equilibrium that is shifted towards the fast-exchanging monomer. H/D exchange in n-propanol-OD, however, showed a partially protected gramicidin that slowly converts to a second species that exchanges nearly all the active hydrogens, indicating EX1 kinetics for the H/D exchange. We propose that this behavior is the result of the slower rate of unfolding in n-propanol compared with that in methanol. The rate constant for the unfolding of the dimer is the rate of disappearance of the partially protected species, and it agrees within a factor of two with a value reported in literature. The rate constant of dimer refolding can be determined from the ratio of the rate constant for unfolding and the affinity constant for the dimer, which we determined in an earlier study. The unfolding activation energy is 20 kcal mol(-1), determined by performing the exchange experiments as a function of temperature. To study gramicidin in an even more hydrophobic medium than n-propanol, we measured its H/D exchange kinetics in a phospholipids vesicle and found a different H/D amide exchange behavior. Gramicidin is an unusual peptide dimer that can exhibit both EX1 and EX2 mechanisms for its H/D exchange, depending on the solvent.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19631556 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Chitta RK, Rempel DL, Gross ML</author>\n    <category>J Am Soc Mass Spectrom</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19631556</guid>\n</item>	5	1251779357

About 80% of the unfolded lysozyme molecules refold on a slow pathway with well-populated intermediates. The remaining 20% of denatured lysozyme refold on a fast track without detectable intermediate. This kinetic heterogeneity has been proposed to originate from the collapsed state of lysozyme folding. Using the method of disulfide scrambling, we demonstrate in this report that these two populations of unfolded lysozyme can be isolated and analyzed separately. GdmCl (6 M) denatured lysozyme actually comprises two major populations of unfolded isomers, namely X-LYZ-a and X-LYZ-b with molar ratio of about 80:20. X-LYZ-a and X-LYZ-b exist in equilibrium in the unfolded state. Their disulfide structures and CD properties indicate that X-LYZ-a is more extensively unfolded than X-LYZ-b. Refolding experiments using the method of disulfide scrambling also show that folding kinetics of X-LYZ-a is about 8-10 times slower than that of X-LYZ-b and folding intermediates of X-LYZ-a is far more heterogeneous than that of X-LYZ-b.

Mutations were predicted in 5 out of 13 interfacial residues on fasciculin, preserving most of the polar inter-molecular contacts seen in the wild-type toxin/enzyme complex. To experimentally characterize fasciculin mutants, we developed an efficient strategy to over-express the toxin in Escherichia coli, followed by refolding to the native conformation. Despite our predictions, a designed quintuple fasciculin mutant displayed reduced affinity for the enzyme. However, removal of a single mutation in the designed sequence produced a quadruple mutant with improved affinity. Moreover, one designed mutation produced 7-fold enhancement in affinity for acetylcholinesterase. This led us to reassess our criteria for enhancing affinity of the toxin for the enzyme. We observed that the change in the predicted inter-molecular energy, rather than in the total energy, correlates well with the change in the experimental free energy of binding, and hence may serve as a criterion for enhancement of affinity in protein-protein complexes.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19643977 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Sharabi O, Peleg Y, Mashiach E, Vardy E, Ashani Y, Silman I, Sussman JL, Shifman JM</author>\n    <category>Protein Eng Des Sel</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19643977</guid>\n</item>	0	1251957497

The unstable nature of unliganded MHC necessitates the production of recombinant class I complexes through in vitro refolding reactions in the presence of an added excess of peptides. This strategy is not amenable to high-throughput production of vast collections of class I complexes. To address this issue, we recently designed photocaged MHC ligands that can be cleaved by a UV light trigger in the MHC bound state under conditions that do not affect the integrity of the MHC structure. The results obtained with photocaged MHC ligands demonstrate that conditional MHC ligands can form a generally applicable concept for the creation of defined peptide-MHCs. However, the use of UV exposure to mediate ligand exchange is unsuited for a number of applications, due to the lack of UV penetration through cell culture systems and due to the transfer of heat upon UV irradiation, which can induce evaporation. To overcome these limitations, here, we provide proof-of-concept for the generation of defined peptide-MHCs by chemical trigger-induced ligand exchange. The crystal structure of the MHC with the novel chemosensitive ligand showcases that the ligand occupies the expected binding site, in a conformation where the hydroxyl groups should be reactive to periodate. We proceed to validate this technology by producing peptide-MHCs that can be used for T cell detection. The methodology that we describe here should allow loading of MHCs with defined peptides in cell culture devices, thereby permitting antigen-specific T cell expansion and purification for cell therapy. In addition, this technology will be useful to develop miniaturized assay systems for performing high-throughput screens for natural and unnatural MHC ligands.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19655751 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Rodenko B, Toebes M, Celie PH, Perrakis A, Schumacher TN, Ovaa H</author>\n    <category>J Am Chem Soc</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19655751</guid>\n</item>	23	1252142374

Ribonuclease A (RNase A) and its homologs, forming the RNase A superfamily, provide an excellent model system for respective studies. RNase A has been used extensively as a model protein for folding studies. However, little is known about the folding of homologous RNases. Here, we analyze the folding pathway of Onconase, a homologous protein from the Northern leopard frog with great potential as tumor therapeutic, by high-resolution techniques. Although Onconase and RNase A significantly differ in the primary structure (28% sequence identity) and in thermodynamic stability (DeltaDeltaG = 20 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), both enzymes possess very similar tertiary structures. The present folding studies on Onconase by rapid mixing techniques in combination with fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy allow the structural assignment of the three kinetic phases observed in stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy. After a slow peptidyl-prolyl &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-to-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; isomerization reaction in the unfolded state, ONC folds via an on-pathway intermediate to the native state. By quenched-flow hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments coupled with 2D NMR spectroscopy, 31 amino acid residues were identified to be involved in the structure formation of the intermediate. 12 of these residues are identical in the RNase A sequence, which is a significantly higher percentage (39%) than the overall 28% sequence identity. Moreover, the structure of this intermediate closely resembles two of the intermediates that occur early during the refolding of RNase A. Obviously, in spite of considerable differences in their amino acid sequence the initial folding events of both proteins are comparable, guided by a limited number of conserved residues.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19655705 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Schulenburg C, LÃ¶w C, Weininger U, Mrestani-Klaus C, Hofmann H, Balbach J, Ulbrich-Hofmann R, Arnold U</author>\n    <category>Biochemistry</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19655705</guid>\n</item>	1	1252557399

The addition of surfactant unfolds the protein by the formation of micellelike aggregates of surfactants along the unfolded polypeptide chains of the protein and depends on the ratio of surfactant to protein concentration. We make use of the dilution method to show the refolding of unfolded proteins in the presence of urea and surfactant. BSA does not show any protein unfolding up to the pressure of 450 MPa. The presence of urea and surfactant (for concentrations prior to inducing their own unfolding) has been used to examine pressure-induced unfolding of the protein at lower pressures.

The prokaryotic heat-shock protein DnaK is the E. coli representative of the ubiquitous Hsp70 family, which specializes in the binding of exposed hydrophobic regions in unfolded polypeptides. Accurate prediction of DnaK binding sites in E. coli proteins is an essential prerequisite to understand the precise function of this chaperone and the properties of its substrate proteins. In order to map DnaK binding sites in protein sequences, we have developed an algorithm that combines sequence information from peptide binding experiments and structural parameters from homology modelling. We show that this combination significantly outperforms either single approach. The final predictor had a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.819 when assessed over the 144 tested peptide sequences to detect true positives and true negatives. To test the robustness of the learning set, we have conducted a simulated cross-validation, where we omit sequences from the learning sets and calculate the rate of repredicting them. This resulted in a surprisingly good MCC of 0.703. The algorithm was also able to perform equally well on a blind test set of binders and non-binders, of which there was no prior knowledge in the learning sets.

Emerging models, founded on structural studies, suggest that the LC8 dimer promotes the stability and refolding of dimeric target proteins in molecular complexes and its interactions with selective target proteins, including dynein subunits, is regulated by LC8 phosphorylation which is proposed to prevent LC8 dimerization. To test these hypotheses in vivo, we determine the impacts of two new LC8 mutations on the assembly and stability of defined LC8-containing complexes in Chlamydomonas flagella. The three types of dyneins and the radial spoke are disparately affected by dimeric LC8 with a C-terminal extension. The defects include absence of specific subunits, complex instability and reduced incorporation into the axonemal super complex. Surprisingly, a phosphomimetic LC8 mutation, that is largely monomeric in vitro, is still dimeric in vivo and does not significantly change flagellar generation and motility. The differential defects in these flagellar complexes support the structural model and indicate that modulation of target proteins by LC8 leads to the proper assembly of complexes and ultimately higher level complexes. Furthermore, the ability of flagellar complexes to incorporate the phosphomimetic LC8 protein and the modest defects observed in the phosphomimetic LC8 mutant suggest that LC8 phosphorylation is not an effective mechanism for regulating molecular complexes.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19696030 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Yang P, Yang C, Wirschell M, Davis S</author>\n    <category>J Biol Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19696030</guid>\n</item>	0	1253006398

The folding of only a few membrane proteins, however, has been characterised in different lipid environments. We have refolded the small multidrug transporter EmrE in vitro from a denatured state to a functional protein and monitored the influence of lipids on the folding process. EmrE is part of a multidrug resistance protein family that is highly conserved amongst bacteria and is responsible for bacterial resistance to toxic substances. We find that the secondary structure of EmrE is very stable and only small amounts are denatured even in the presence of unusually high denaturant concentrations involving a combination of 10 M urea and 5 % sodium dodecylsulfate. Substrate binding by EmrE is recovered after refolding this denatured protein into dodecylmaltoside detergent micelles or into lipid vesicles. The yield of refolded EmrE decreases with lipid bilayer compositional changes that increase the lateral chain pressure within the bilayer, whilst conversely, the apparent rate of folding seems to increase. These results add further weight to the hypothesis that an increased lateral chain pressure hinders protein insertion across the bilayer. Once the protein is inserted, however, the greater pressure on the transmembrane helices accelerates correct packing and final folding.

The large-scale conformational changes associated with these complexes require new approaches. Historically, a crucial component of motion analysis has been the identification of moving rigid blocks from the comparison of different conformations. However, existing tools do not allow consistent block identification in very large structures. Here, we describe a novel method, RigidFinder, for such identification of rigid blocks from different conformations-across many scales, from large complexes to small loops. RigidFinder defines rigidity in terms of blocks, where inter-residue distances are conserved across conformations. Distance conservation, unlike the averaged values (e.g., RMSD) used by many other methods, allows for sensitive identification of motions. A further distinguishing feature of our method, is that, it is capable of finding blocks made from nonconsecutive fragments of multiple polypeptide chains. In our implementation, we utilize an efficient quasi-dynamic programming search algorithm that allows for real-time application to very large structures. RigidFinder can be used at a dedicated web server (http://rigidfinder.molmovdb.org). The server also provides links to examples at various scales such as loop closure, domain motions, partial refolding, and subunit shifts. Moreover, here we describe the detailed application of RigidFinder to four large structures: Pyruvate Phosphate Dikinase, T7 RNA polymerase, RNA polymerase II, and GroEL. The results of the method are in excellent agreement with the expert-described rigid blocks. Proteins 2009.

Among the various plant Hsps (i.e. Hsp100, Hsp90, Hsp70 and Hsp20), Hsp20 or small Hsps (sHsps) are expressed in maximal amounts under high temperature stress. The characteristic feature of the sHsps is the presence of alpha-crystallin domain (ACD) at the C-terminus. sHsps cooperate with Hsp100/Hsp70 and co-chaperones in ATP-dependent manner in preventing aggregation of cellular proteins and in their subsequent refolding. Database search was performed to investigate the sHsp gene family across rice genome sequence followed by comprehensive expression analysis of these genes. RESULTS: We identified 40 alpha-crystallin domain containing genes in rice. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 23 out of these 40 genes constitute sHsps. The additional 17 genes containing ACD clustered with Acd proteins of Arabidopsis. Detailed scrutiny of 23 sHsp sequences enabled us to categorize these proteins in a revised scheme of classification constituting of 16 cytoplasmic/nuclear, 2 ER, 3 mitochondrial, 1 plastid and 1 peroxisomal genes. In the new classification proposed herein nucleo-cytoplasmic class of sHsps with 9 subfamilies is more complex in rice than in Arabidopsis. Strikingly, 17 of 23 rice sHsp genes were noted to be intronless. Expression analysis based on microarray and RT-PCR showed that 19 sHsp genes were upregulated by high temperature stress. Besides heat stress, expression of sHsp genes was up or downregulated by other abiotic and biotic stresses. In addition to stress regulation, various sHsp genes were differentially upregulated at different developmental stages of the rice plant. Majority of sHsp genes were expressed in seed. CONCLUSIONS: We identified twenty three sHsp genes and seventeen Acd genes in rice. Three nucleocytoplasmic sHsp genes were found only in monocots. Analysis of expression profiling of sHsp genes revealed that these genes are differentially expressed under stress and at different stages in the life cycle of rice plant.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19703271 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Sarkar NK, Kim YK, Grover A</author>\n    <category>BMC Genomics</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19703271</guid>\n</item>	0	1253093214

Its function is executed in cooperation with the co-chaperonin, mHsp10, and requires ATP. Recently, the discovery of a new mHsp60-associated neurodegenerative disorder, MitCHAP-60 disease, has been reported. The disease is caused by a point mutation at position 3 (D3G) of the mature mitochondrial Hsp60 protein, which renders it unable to complement the deletion of the homologous bacterial protein in E. coli [Magen et al. (2008) Am. J. Hum. Genet, 83, 30-42]. The molecular basis of the MitCHAP-60 disease is still unknown. In this study, we present an in vitro structural and functional analysis of the purified wild-type human mHsp60 and the MitCHAP-60 mutant. We show that the D3G mutation leads to destabilization of the mHsp60 oligomer and causes its disassembly at low protein concentrations. We also show that the mutant protein has impaired protein folding and ATPase activities. An additional mutant that lacks the first three amino acids (N-del), including D3, is similarly impaired in refolding activity. Surprisingly, however, this mutant exhibits profound stabilization of its oligomeric structure. These results suggest that the D3G mutation leads to entropic destabilization of the mHsp60 oligomer, which severely impairs its chaperone function, thereby causing the disease.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19706612 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Parnas A, Nadler M, Nisemblat S, Horovitz A, Mandel H, Azem A</author>\n    <category>J Biol Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19706612</guid>\n</item>	50	1253154091

Here we used the Candida group I intron as a model to address the question. We show that co-transcriptional folding of the active self-splicing intron is twice as fast as refolding. The P3-P7 pseudoknot folds slowly during co-transcriptional folding at a rate constant similar to the folding of the active ribozyme, and folding of both P3-P7 and P1-P10 pseudoknots are inhibited by antisense oligonucleotides. We conclude that when RNA folding is coupled with transcription, formation of pseudoknot structures dominates the productive folding pathway and serves as a rate-limiting step in producing the self-splicing competent Candida intron.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19710184 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Zhang L, Bao P, Leibowitz MJ, Zhang Y</author>\n    <category>RNA</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19710184</guid>\n</item>	12	1253154091

Like other class I viral fusion proteins, F is expressed as a pre-fusion metastable protein that undergoes a refolding event to induce fusion. HN binding to its receptor triggers F refolding by an unknown mechanism. HN could serve as a clamp that stabilizes F in its pre-fusion state until HN binds the target cell (clamp model). Alternatively, HN itself could undergo a conformational change after receptor binding that destabilizes F and causes F to trigger (provocateur model). To examine F-HN interactions by bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), the cytoplasmic tails of parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) F and HN were fused to complementary fragments of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). Co-expression of the BiFC constructs resulted in fluorescence; however, co-expression with unrelated BiFC constructs also produced fluorescence. The affinity of the two halves of YFP presumably superseded the F-HN interaction. Unexpectedly, co-expression of the BiFC F and HN greatly enhanced fusion using multiple cell types. We hypothesize that the increase in fusion occurs because the BiFC tags bring F and HN together more frequently than occurs in a wt scenario. This implies that normally much of wt F is not associated with wt HN, in conflict with the 'clamp model' for activation. Correspondingly, we show that wt PIV5 fusion occurs in an HN concentration-dependent manner. Also inconsistent with the 'clamp model' are the findings that BiFC F does not adopt a post-fusion conformation when expressed in the absence of HN and HN co-expression does not provide resistance to the heat-induced triggering of F. In support of a 'provocateur model' of F activation, we demonstrate by analysis of the morphology of soluble F trimers that the hyperfusogenic mutation S443P has a destabilizing effect on F.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19710150 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Connolly SA, Leser GP, Jardetzky TS, Lamb RA</author>\n    <category>J Virol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19710150</guid>\n</item>	4	1253328249

In IL/2% ddH(2)O (v/v) mixtures, loop 1 of domain I is more significantly denatured in comparison to the protein dissolved in aqueous solutions containing strong chemical denaturants (e.g., 8 M guanidine HCl (Gu.HCl) or urea). As water loading increases, there is evidence for progressive refolding of loop 1 of domain I followed by recoupling with domains I, II, and III in the [C(4)mim][BF(4)]/ddH(2)O mixtures at 20 degrees C. Above 30% (v/v) water, where domain I appears refolded, the Ac reporter molecule's semiangle steadily decreases from 35 degrees to 20 degrees with increasing water loading. From the perspective of domain I in HSA, this behavior is similar to the effects of dilution from 4 to 0 M Gu.HCl in aqueous solution. Overall, these results lend insight into the tangle of biocatalytic and structural/dynamical mechanisms that enzymes may undergo in ionic liquid-based systems.

In the absence of the PS, native pepsin (Np) is irreversibly denatured and when placed under refolding conditions, folds to a thermodynamically stable denatured state. This denatured, refolded pepsin (Rp) state can be converted to Np by the exogenous addition of the PS, which catalyzes the folding of Rp to Np. In order to thoroughly study the mechanism by which the PS catalyzes pepsin folding, a soluble protein expression system was developed to produce recombinant PS peptide in a highly pure form. Using this system, the wild-type and three mutant PS forms, in which single residue substitutions were made (V4A, R8A and K36A), were expressed and purified. These PS peptides were characterized for their ability to inhibit Np enzymatic activity and to catalyze the folding of Rp to Np. The V4A, R8A and K36A mutant PS peptides were found to have nanomolar inhibition constants, K(i), of 82.4, 58.3 and 95.6 nM, respectively, approximately a two-fold increase from that of the wild-type PS (36.2 nM). All three mutant PS peptides were found to catalyze Np folding with a rate constant of 0.06 min(-1), five-fold lower than that of the wild-type. The observation that the mutant PS peptides retained their inhibition and folding-catalyst functionality suggests a high level of resilience to mutations of the pepsin PS.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19715777 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Dee DR, Filonowicz S, Horimoto Y, Yada RY</author>\n    <category>Biochim Biophys Acta</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19715777</guid>\n</item>	29	1253772707

For charge complexation of the siRNA, the DARPin was fused to a truncated human protamine-1 sequence. To increase the cell binding affinity and the amount of siRNA delivered into cells, DARPin dimers were generated and used as fusion proteins with protamine. All proteins expressed well in Escherichia coli in soluble form, yet, to remove tightly bound bacterial nucleic acids, they were purified under denaturing conditions by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography, followed by refolding. The fusion proteins were capable of complexing four to five siRNA molecules per protamine, and fully retained the binding specificity for EpCAM as shown on MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells. In contrast to unspecific LipofectAMINE transfection, down-regulation of antiapoptotic bcl-2 using fusion protein complexed siRNA was strictly dependent on EpCAM binding and internalization.

The ACA method increased the lysozyme refolding yield by 40% over the simple dilution approach. Similarly, for alpha-glucosidase, the refolding yield using the ACA method (ca. 50%) was approximately three times compared with the simple dilution method.

Apoptosis is triggered when a peptide containing a BH3 motif, or a small molecule BH3 peptidomimetic, such as ABT 737, binds to the relevant Bcl-2 family members. ABT-737 is an antagonist of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w, but not of Mcl-1. Here we describe new structures of mutant BH3 peptides bound to Bcl-xL and Mcl-1. These structures suggested a rationale for the failure of ABT-737 to bind Mcl-1, but a designed variant of ABT-737 failed to acquire binding affinity for Mcl-1. Rather, it was selective for Bcl-xL, a result attributable in part to significant backbone refolding and movements of helical segments in its ligand-binding site. To date, there are few reported crystal structures of organic ligands in complex with their pro-survival protein targets. Our structure of this new organic ligand provided insights into the structural transitions that occur within the BH3-binding groove, highlighting significant differences in the structural properties of members of the Bcl-2 pro-survival protein family. Such differences are likely to influence and be important in the quest for compounds capable of selectively antagonizing the different family members.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19726685 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Lee EF, Czabotar PE, Yang H, Sleebs BE, Lessene G, Colman PM, Smith BJ, Fairlie WD</author>\n    <category>J Biol Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19726685</guid>\n</item>	39	1254550492

Furthermore, other nucleoside phosphates (guanosine, cytidine, uridine, and inosine phosphates) in addition to adenine nucleotides were hydrolyzed. From analyses of the products of hydrolysis using HPLC, it was revealed that the monomeric chaperonin successively hydrolyzed the phosphoanhydride and phosphoester bonds of ATP in the order of gamma to alpha. This activity was strongly suppressed by point mutation of specific essential aspartic acid residues. Although these archaeal monomeric chaperonins did not alter the refolding of MDH, their novel versatile nucleotide hydrolysis activity might fulfill a new function.

We identify over 170 members of this cytosolic Escherichia coli TF substrate proteome, including ribosomal protein S7. We analyzed the biochemical properties of a TF:S7 complex from Thermotoga maritima and determined its crystal structure. Thereby, we obtained an atomic-level picture of a promiscuous chaperone in complex with a physiological substrate protein.

By monitoring the refolding of SsMTAPII, PfPNP and their mutants lacking the C-terminal cysteine pair after guanidine-induced unfolding, we demonstrated that the CXC motif is required for the folding of these enzymes. Moreover, two synthesized CXC-containing peptides with the same amino acid sequences present in the C-terminal regions of SsMTAPII and PfPNP were found to act as in vitro catalysts of oxidative folding. These small peptides are involved in the folding of partially refolded SsMTAPII, PfPNP and their CXC-lacking mutants, with a concomitant recovery of their catalytic activity, thus indicating that the CXC motif is necessary to obtain complete reversibility from the unfolded state of the two proteins.

We apply atomic force microscopy to locally probe the mechanical folding/unfolding process of a well-understood model coiled coil when unstructured subsegments with different sizes are added. We find that the refolding force decreases from 7.8 pN with increasing size of the added unstructured subsegment, while the unfolding properties of the model coiled coil remain unchanged. We show that this behavior results from the increased size of the nucleation seed which has to form before further coiled-coil folding can proceed. Since the nucleation seed size is linked to the width of the energetic folding barrier, we are able to directly measure the dependence of folding forces on the barrier width.

We also show that the interaction of WT p53 with WAF1 promoter in cells is sensitive to Hsp70 and Hsp90 inhibition already at 37 degrees C and further decreased on heat shock. The influence of chaperones on p53 binding to the WAF1 promoter sequence has been confirmed in vitro, using highly purified proteins. Hsp90 stabilizes the binding of p53 to the promoter sequence at 37 degrees C, whereas under heat-shock conditions the requirement for the Hsp70-Hsp40 system and its cooperation with Hsp90 increases. Hop co-chaperone additionally stimulates these reactions. Interestingly, the combined Hsp90 and Hsp70-Hsp40 allow for a limited in vitro restoration of the DNA-binding activity by the p53 oncogenic variant R249S and affect its conformation in cells.

It is highly soluble and does not require additional refolding, oxidation, or reduction steps during its purification. Using surface plasmon resonance technology and competitive binding assays, we have shown that Affitoxin binds specifically to HER2 with nanomolar affinity. We have also observed a high correlation between HER2 expression and retention of Affitoxin bound to the cell surface. Affitoxin binding and internalization is followed by Pseudomonas exotoxin A activity domain-mediated ADP-ribosylation of translation elongation factor 2 and, consequently, inhibition of protein synthesis as shown by protein expression analysis of HER2-positive cells treated with Affitoxin.

The apoprotein of glycine oxidase shows high protein fluorescence, high exposure of hydrophobic surfaces, and low temperature stability as compared to the holoenzyme. The isolated apoprotein species is present in solution as a monomer which rapidly recovers its tertiary structure and converts into the tetrameric holoenzyme following incubation with free FAD. The reconstitution process follows a particular two-stage process; the spectral properties of the reconstituted holoenzyme were virtually indistinguishable from those observed with native glycine oxidase, while the activity was only partially (50%) recovered. The urea-induced unfolding process of glycine oxidase can be considered as a two-step (three-state) process: the presence of intermediate(s) in the unfolding process of the holoenzyme at approximately 2 M urea is evident in the changes of the flavin fluorescence intensity and can be also inferred from the different urea sensitivities of the spectral probes used. On the other hand, only a single transition at approximately 4.5 M urea concentration is observed for the apoprotein form. The chemical denaturation of glycine oxidase holoenzyme is partially reversible (e.g., no activity is recovered when starting the refolding from 4 M urea-denatured holoprotein). Finally, the introduction by site-directed mutagenesis of residues corresponding to those involved in the covalent link with FAD in the related flavoenzyme monomeric sarcosine oxidase failed to convert glycine oxidase into a covalent flavoprotein. These investigations show that the consequences of FAD binding for the stability and folding process distinguish glycine oxidase from enzymes active on similar compounds.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19751796 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Caldinelli L, Pedotti M, Motteran L, Molla G, Pollegioni L</author>\n    <category>Biochimie</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19751796</guid>\n</item>	12	1255598092

In the native state, the heme groups are deeply buried in the hydrophobic pockets of Hb with a five-coordinate high-spin complex and thus show a poor electrochemical property at bare GC electrodes. Upon the unfolding of Hb induced by the denaturant of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl), the fifth coordinative bond between the heme groups and the residue of the polypeptides (His-F8) is broken, and as a result, the heme groups initially buried deeply in the hydrophobic pockets dissociate from the polypeptide chains and are reduced electrochemically at GC electrodes, which can be used to probe the unfolding of Hb. The results on the GdnHCl-induced Hb unfolding obtained with the electrochemical method described here well coincide with those studied with other methods, such as UV-vis spectroscopy, fluorescence, and circular dichroism. The application of the as-established electrochemical method is illustrated to study the kinetics of GdnHCl-induced Hb unfolding, the GdnHCl-induced unfolding of another kind of hemoprotein, catalase, and the pH-induced Hb unfolding/refolding.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19754140 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Li X, Zheng W, Zhang L, Yu P, Lin Y, Su L, Mao L</author>\n    <category>Anal Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19754140</guid>\n</item>	2	1256104821

Synthetic peptides derived from the gp41 C-terminal heptad repeat domain (C-peptides) potently inhibit fusion by binding to the gp41 pre-bundle intermediates and blocking their conversion into the 6HB. Our recent work revealed that HIV-1 enters cells by fusing with endosomes, but not with the plasma membrane. These studies also showed that, for the large part, gp41 pre-bundles progress toward 6HBs in endosomal compartments and are thus protected from external fusion inhibitors. Here, we examined the consequences of endocytic entry on the gp41 pre-bundle exposure and on the virus' sensitivity to C-peptides. The rates of CD4 and coreceptor binding, as well as the rate of productive receptor-mediated endocytosis, were measured by adding specific inhibitors of these steps at varied times of virus-cell incubation. Following the CD4 binding, CCR5-tropic viruses recruited a requisite number of coreceptors much faster than CXCR4-tropic viruses. The rate of subsequent uptake of ternary Env-CD4-coreceptor complexes did not correlate with the kinetics of coreceptor engagement. These measurements combined with kinetic analyses enabled the determination of the lifetime of pre-bundle intermediates on the cell surface. Overall, these lifetimes correlated with the inhibitory potency of C-peptides. On the other hand, the basal sensitivity to peptides varied considerably among diverse HIV-1 isolates and ranked similarly with their susceptibility to inactivation by soluble CD4. We conclude that both the longevity of gp41 intermediates and the extent of irreversible conformational changes in Env upon CD4 binding determine the antiviral potency of C-peptides.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19763181 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Miyauchi K, Kozlov MM, Melikyan GB</author>\n    <category>PLoS Pathog</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19763181</guid>\n</item>	14	1256104821

Cases occur largely in rural areas of the South and East Asian region resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Multiple vaccines exist to control Japanese encephalitis, but all suffer from problems. Envelope protein domain III of Japanese encephalitis virus is involved in binding to host receptors and it contains specific epitopes that elicit virus-neutralizing antibodies. Earlier, the protective efficacy of domain III has been evaluated in mice by some researchers, but these studies are lacking in explanation of humoral and cellular immune responses. We have earlier reported cloning, expression, purification and in vitro refolding of Japanese encephalitis virus envelope protein domain III (rJEV-DIII). Ninety percent JEV is neutralized when the serum against refolded rJEV-DIII is used at a dilution of 1:80. In the present study, we have evaluated the immunomodulatory potential of refolded rJEV-DIII protein in BALB/c mice with Freunds complete/incomplete adjuvants. Mice were tested for humoral immune response by ELISA. Cell-mediated immune response was tested by lymphocyte proliferation assay and cytokine profiling. The rJEV-DIII generated high IgG antibody and its isotypes (IgG2a and IgG3) and induced significant expression of INF-gamma and IL-2 cytokines. The rJEV-DIII induced significant lymphoproliferation of splenocytes.

We genetically fused A&amp;beta;42 to the N-terminus of vYFP, a variant of of GFP, and expressed and purified the folded fusion protein. The refolding efficiency of A&amp;beta;42-vYFP fusion was inversely correlated with the solubility of A&amp;beta;42. Using fluorescence to monitor refolding of A&amp;beta;42-vYFP, we confirmed that Zn2+ binds to A&amp;beta;42 and increases its aggregation. The IC50 value estimated for Zn binding is 3.03 +/- 0.65 micromol/L. We also show that this technique is capable of monitoring the aggregation of chemically synthesized A&amp;beta;42.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19767826 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Arslan PE, Chakrabartty A</author>\n    <category>Biochem Cell Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19767826</guid>\n</item>	10	1256372305

A close similarity between equilibrium molten globule states and kinetic species observed during refolding has been reported for several proteins. However, the experimental conditions, and in particular the pH, under which the equilibrium and kinetic species are studied often differ significantly. For human alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-LA), the equilibrium molten globule is most often studied at pH 2, the so called A-state, while kinetic refolding experiments are performed at neutral pH. alpha-LA contains a large number of acidic amino acid residues which may influence the properties of the molten globule differently at low and neutral pH. In this study we investigate the structural preferences of the alpha-LA molten globule at pH 7 at the level of individual residues using NMR spectroscopy and compare these data with previous results obtained at pH 2. We show that differences exist in the conformational ensemble that describes the alpha-LA molten globule at these two pH values. The molten globule at pH 7 is generally less stable than the low pH A-state. Most notable are differences in the stability of structure for the C-helix and the calcium-binding loop that precedes it and differences in the contribution of long-range hydrophobic contacts between the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the alpha-domain to stability of the molten globule. Our results are discussed in the context of previous studies of the alpha-LA molten globule and can be used to reconcile apparent discrepancies in published data relating to the C-helix. In the light of our results, the low pH A-state may not be the best model for the kinetic molten globule observed during refolding of alpha-LA. The pH-dependent effects reported here for alpha-LA may be of relevance in comparisons of equilibrium and kinetic molten globules of other proteins.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19766656 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> RÃ¶sner HI, Redfield C</author>\n    <category>J Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19766656</guid>\n</item>	172	1256372305

Comparison of heat treatment of native lysozyme and oxidative refolding from the reduced and denatured state of lysozyme in the presence of 44 different additives revealed an indispensable chemical structure for the additives to be effective against heat-induced misfolding and for refolding. The additives effective against heat treatment of native lysozyme possessed a main chain of the amino acid moiety. Amino acids that have esterificated and amidated carboxy groups prevented heat-induced misfoldings more effectively than amino acids themselves. On the other hand, the additives effective against oxidative refolding possessed a guanidium or ureido group. The former additives prevented hydrophobic interaction between the main chains of the unfolded polypeptide, while the latter additives increased the solubility of the aromatic and aliphatic side-chains. These data also support the fact that arginine (Arg) and Arg derivatives are versatile additives for both misfolding processes. (c) 2009 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

However, recent studies have shown that glypican core proteins also have a role in growth factor signalling. Here, we expressed secreted recombinant human glypican-1 in eukaryotic cells. Recombinant glypican-1 was expressed as two glycoforms, one as proteoglycan substituted with heparan sulfate chains and one as core protein devoid of glycosaminoglycans. Far-UV circular dichroism (CD) analysis of glypican-1 isolated under native conditions showed that the glypican-1 core protein is predominantly -helical in structure, with identical spectra for the core protein and the proteoglycan form. The conformational stability of glypican-1 core protein to urea and guanidine-HCl denaturation was monitored by CD and fluorescence spectroscopy, and showed a single unfolding transition at high concentrations of the denaturant (5.8 and 2.6 M, respectively). Renaturation from guanidine-HCl gave far-UV CD and fluorescence spectra identical to the spectra of native glypican-1. Thermal denaturation monitored by CD and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed a single structural transition at a temperature of around 70oC. Refolding of heat-denatured glypican-1 core protein was dependent on protein concentration, suggesting that intermolecular interactions are involved in irreversible denaturation. However, refolding was concentration-independent for the proteoglycan form, suggesting that O-glycosylation protects the protein from irreversible aggregation. In summary, we have shown that glypican-1 core protein is a stable alfa-helical protein and that the proteoglycan form of glypican-1 is protected from heat-induced aggregation.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19775117 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Svensson G, Linse S, Mani K</author>\n    <category>Biochemistry</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19775117</guid>\n</item>	1	1256611819

Recombinant Der (rDer) p 2 with high IgE binding activity can be readily produced in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris, but the structure and IgE binding of the different methods of preparation have not been compared. Methods: Secondary structure was assessed by circular dichroism (CD). Intrinsic fluorescence and hydrophobic probe (1-anilinonaphthalene 8-sulphonic acid, ANS) were used to study the Der p 2 hydrophobic cavity. IgE binding was assessed by ELISA inhibition. Results: CD analysis showed the expected secondary structure for both nDer p 2 and refolded Der p 2 prepared from E. coli inclusion bodies but primarily random structure for Der p 2 secreted from P. pastoris. The secreted product, however, had disulphide bonding and could be refolded to a similar structure to natural Der (nDer) p 2 after precipitation with trichloro-acetic or ammonium sulphate. ANS binding and intrinsic Trp92 fluorescence showed that all recombinant proteins were different to nDer p 2 and that the allergen secreted from P. pastoris did not form a hydrophobic cavity. Despite the marked structural changes, all preparations of Der p 2 had similar IgE binding to nDer p 2. Conclusion: Despite almost identical IgE binding, rDer p 2 prepared from both E. coli and P. pastoris showed structural differences to nDer p 2. Der p 2 secreted from P. pastoris lacked most of the natural structure, but refolding could induce the natural structure.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19786799 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Tanyaratsrisakul S, Malainual N, Jirapongsananuruk O, Smith WA, Thomas WR, Piboonpocanun S</author>\n    <category>Int Arch Allergy Immunol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19786799</guid>\n</item>	79	1256611819

Dimerization is central to procaspase activation because the active sites are comprised of loops from both monomers. While initiator procaspases are stable monomers until activated on cell death scaffolds, the effector caspases, such as procaspase-3, are stable dimers. The activation mechanisms are reasonably well understood in terms of polypeptide chain cleavage and subsequent active site rearrangements in the dimer, but the mechanisms that govern dimer assembly are not known. In order to further understand procaspase dimerization, we examined the folding and assembly of procaspase-3 by fluorescence emission, circular dichroism, differential quenching by acrylamide, anisotropy and enzyme activity assays. Single-mixing stopped-flow refolding studies showed a complex burst phase in which multiple monomeric species form rapidly. At longer times, the monomer folds through several intermediates, some of which appear to be off-pathway or misfolded, before eventually forming a dimerization-competent species. Enzyme activity studies demonstrated a slow rate of dimerization ( approximately 70 M(-1)s(-1)). In addition, single-mixing stopped-flow unfolding studies revealed a complex unfolding process with a slow rate of dimer dissociation. Interestingly, multiple dimeric species were observed in the burst phase for unfolding, suggesting that the native ensemble consists of at least two major conformations. Collectively, these results demonstrate complex folding and unfolding behavior for procaspase-3 and suggest that slow dimerization results from the lack of stabilizing native contacts in the initial encounter complex.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19798740 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Milam SL, Clark AC</author>\n    <category>Protein Sci</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19798740</guid>\n</item>	0	1256611819

Unlike riboswitches restricted to noncoding regions, the interferon-gamma RNA domain that activates PKR comprises the 5' UTR and 26 translated codons. Extensive interferon-gamma coding sequence is thus dedicated to activating PKR and blocking interferon-gamma synthesis. This implies that the PKR activator is disrupted by ribosomes during translation initiation and must refold promptly to restore PKR activation. The activator structure harbors an essential kink-turn, probably to allow formation of a pseudoknot that is critical for PKR activation. Three indispensable short helices, bordered by orientation-sensitive base pairs, align with the pseudoknot stem, generating RNA helix of sufficient length to activate PKR. Through gain-of-function mutations, we show that the RNA activator can adopt alternative conformations that activate PKR. This flexibility promotes efficient refolding of interferon-gamma mRNA, which is necessary for its dual function as translation template and activator of PKR, and which thus prevents overexpression of this inflammatory cytokine.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19801993 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Cohen-Chalamish S, Hasson A, Weinberg D, Namer LS, Banai Y, Osman F, Kaempfer R</author>\n    <category>Nat Chem Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19801993</guid>\n</item>	148	1256789949

For the coronaviruses, viral spike (S) proteins execute these cell entry functions. The S proteins are set apart from other viral and cellular membrane fusion proteins by their extensively palmitoylated membrane-associated tails. Palmitate adducts are generally required for protein-mediated fusions but their precise roles in the process are unclear. To obtain additional insights into the S-mediated membrane fusion process, we focused on these palmitoylated carboxy-terminal intravirion tails. Substituting alanines for the cysteines that are subject to palmitoylation had effects on both S incorporation into virions and S-mediated membrane fusions. In specifically dissecting the effects of endodomain mutations on the fusion process, we used antiviral heptad repeat peptides that bind only to folding intermediates in the S-mediated fusion process, and found that mutants lacking three palmitoylated cysteines remained in transitional folding states nearly ten times longer than native S proteins. This slower refolding was also reflected in the paucity of postfusion six-helix bundle configurations amongst the mutant S proteins. Viruses with fewer palmitoylated S protein cysteines entered cells slowly and had reduced specific infectivities. These findings indicate that lipid adducts anchoring S proteins into virus membranes are necessary for the rapid, productive S protein refolding events that culminate in membrane fusions. These studies reveal a previously unappreciated role for covalently-attached lipids on the endodomains of viral proteins eliciting membrane fusion reactions.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19801669 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Shulla A, Gallagher T</author>\n    <category>J Biol Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19801669</guid>\n</item>	3	1256789949

Over the past two decades there has been an increasing interest in the relationship between HSPs and cardiovascular disease, and particularly whether an autoimmune response may be implicated.

Determination of the crystal structures of these proteins purified in a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-bound form indicates that the structures of DeltaCa2-Pro-S324A and DeltaCa3-Pro-S324A are virtually identical to that of Pro-S324A, except that they lack the Ca2 and Ca3 sites, respectively, and the structure of the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-binding loop is destabilized. Nevertheless, these proteins were slightly more stable than Pro-S324A. These results suggest that the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-binding loop is required for folding of Tk-subtilisin, but does not seriously contribute to the stabilization of Tk-subtilisin in a native structure.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19813760 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Takeuchi Y, Tanaka SI, Matsumura H, Koga Y, Takano K, Kanaya S</author>\n    <category>Biochemistry</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19813760</guid>\n</item>	0	1256980906

CD4 binding induces large conformational changes to gp120, such as the formation of the bridging sheet between the V1/V2 stem and beta20/beta21. Understanding the dynamic process and the mechanism that leads to the formation of the bridging sheet is important. We have studied the formation of the bridging sheet via extensive molecular dynamics simulations on a modeled intermediate state. The intermediate state is derived from the crystal structure of the gp120/CD4 complex with rotation of the alpha1 helix and separation of the V1/V2 stem from beta20/beta21. The molecular dynamics simulations reveal that CD4-bound gp120 leads to the refolding of the bridging sheet but the CD4-free gp120 leads to structures similar to unliganded structures of SIV gp120. The bridging sheet refolds with the S375W mutant, but it does not refold with the W112A and S375W/T257S mutants. Our simulation results are in agreement with experimental observations, and they reveal the importance of the formation of the hydrophobic core to the conformational change of CD4-induced gp120. Other experimental observations, including variations in the binding entropy in different mutants, are also qualitatively reproduced.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19813706 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Da LT, Quan JM, Wu YD</author>\n    <category>J Phys Chem B</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19813706</guid>\n</item>	20	1257302787

Glycerol is known to shift the native protein ensemble to more compact states. Glycerol also inhibits protein aggregation during protein refolding. However, mechanistic insight into protein stabilization and prevention of protein aggregation by glycerol is still lacking. In this study, we derive mechanisms of glycerol-induced protein stabilization by combining the thermodynamic framework of preferential interactions with molecular level insight into solvent-protein interactions gained from molecular simulations. Contrary to the common conception that preferential hydration of proteins in polyol-water mixtures is determined by the molecular size of the polyol and the surface area of the protein, we present evidence that preferential hydration of proteins in glycerol-water mixtures mainly originates from electrostatic interactions that induce orientations of glycerol molecules at the protein surface such that glycerol is further excluded. These interactions shift the native protein towards more compact conformations. Moreover, glycerol preferentially interacts with large patches of contiguous hydrophobicity where glycerol acts as an amphiphilic interface between the hydrophobic surface and the polar solvent. Accordingly, we propose that glycerol prevents protein aggregation by inhibiting protein unfolding and by stabilizing aggregation-prone intermediates through preferential interactions with hydrophobic surface regions that favor amphiphilic interface orientations of glycerol. These mechanisms agree well with experimental data available in literature and we discuss the extent to which these mechanisms apply to other cosolvents including polyols, arginine and urea.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19817484 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Vagenende V, Yap MG, Trout BL</author>\n    <category>Biochemistry</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19817484</guid>\n</item>	0	1257302787

At total surfactant concentrations lower than 60 mmol/L and molar fractions of Triton X-45 less than 0.6, thermodynamically stable reverse micelles of water content (W(0)) up to 30 are formed. Di(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (HDEHP; 1-2 mmol/L) is introduced into the system for chelating transition metal ions that have binding affinity for histidine-rich proteins. HDEHP exists in a dimeric form in organic solvents and a dimer associated with one transition metal ion, including copper, zinc, and nickel. The copper-chelate reverse micelles (Cu-RM) are characterized for their W(0), hydrodynamic radius (R(h)), and aggregation number (N(ag)). Similar with reverse micelles of bis-2-ethylhexyl sodium sulfosuccinate (AOT), R(h) of the Cu-RM is also linearly related to W(0). However, N(ag) is determined to be 30-90 at W(0) of 5-30, only quarter to half of the AOT reverse micelles. Then, selective metal-chelate extraction of histidine-rich protein (myoglobin) by the Cu-RM is successfully performed with pure and mixed protein systems (myoglobin and lysozyme). The solubilized protein can be recovered by stripping with imidazole or ethylinediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution. Because various transition metal ions can be chelated to the reverse micelles, it is convinced that the system would be useful for application in protein purification as well as simultaneous isolation and refolding of recombinant histidine-tagged proteins expressed as inclusion bodies.

The recombinant apoprotein, denatured in dodecyl sulfate, spontaneously folds when it is mixed with its pigments, chlorophylls, and carotenoids in detergent solution, and assembles into structurally authentic LHCII in the course of several minutes. Pulse EPR techniques, specifically double-electron-electron resonance (DEER), have been used to analyze protein folding during this process. Pairs of nitroxide labels were introduced site-specifically into recombinant LHCII and shown not to affect the stability and function of the pigment-protein complex. Interspin distance distributions between two spin pairs were measured at various time points, one pair located on either end of the second transmembrane helix (helix 3), the other one located near the luminal ends of the intertwined transmembrane helices 1 and 4. In the dodecyl sulfate-solubilized apoprotein, both distance distributions were consistent with a random-coil protein structure. A rapid freeze-quench experiment on the latter spin pair indicated that 1 s after initiating reconstitution the protein structure is virtually unchanged. Subsequently, both distance distributions monitored protein folding in the same time range in which the assembly of chlorophylls into the complex had been observed. The positioning of the spin pair spanning the hydrophobic core of LHCII clearly preceded the juxtaposition of the spin pair on the luminal side of the complex.

Here, we investigate the in vitro refolding mechanism of a large beta-helix protein, pertactin, which has an extended, elongated shape. At 55 kDa, this single domain, all-beta-sheet protein allows detailed analysis of the formation of beta-sheet structure in larger proteins. Using a combination of fluorescence and far-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy, we show that the pertactin beta-helix refolds remarkably slowly, with multiexponential kinetics. Surprisingly, despite the slow refolding rates, large size, and beta-sheet-rich topology, pertactin refolding is reversible and not complicated by off-pathway aggregation. The slow pertactin refolding rate is not limited by proline isomerization, and 30% of secondary structure formation occurs within the rate-limiting step. Furthermore, site-specific labeling experiments indicate that the beta-helix refolds in a multistep but concerted process involving the entire protein, rather than via initial formation of the stable core substructure observed in equilibrium titrations. Hence pertactin provides a valuable system for studying the refolding properties of larger, beta-sheet-rich proteins, and raises intriguing questions regarding the prevention of aggregation during the prolonged population of partially folded, beta-sheet-rich refolding intermediates.

A model is provided by proinsulin, whose misfolding is associated with beta-cell dysfunction and diabetes mellitus. An insulin analog containing a subtle core substitution (Leu(A16)--&gt;Val) is biologically active, and its crystal structure recapitulates that of the wild-type protein. As a seeming paradox, however, Val(A16) blocks both insulin chain combination and the in vitro refolding of proinsulin. Disulfide pairing in mammalian cell culture is likewise inefficient, leading to misfolding, endoplasmic reticular (ER) stress, and proteosome-mediated degradation. Val(A16) destabilizes the native state and so presumably perturbs a partial fold that directs initial disulfide pairing. Substitutions elsewhere in the core similarly destabilize the native state, but unlike Val(A16), preserve folding efficiency. We propose that Leu(A16) stabilizes non-local interactions between nascent alpha-helices in the A- and B-domains to facilitate initial pairing of Cys(A20) and Cys(B19), thus surmounting their wide separation in sequence. Although Val(A16) must profoundly destabilize this proto-core, its structural effects are mitigated once folding is achieved. Classical studies of insulin chain combination in vitro have illuminated the impact of off-pathway reactions on the efficiency of native disulfide pairing. The capability of a polypeptide sequence to fold within the ER may likewise be influenced by kinetic or thermodynamic partitioning among on- and off-pathway disulfide intermediates. The properties of Val(A16)-insulin and Val(A16)-proinsulin demonstrate that essential contributions of conserved residues to folding may be inapparent once the native state is achieved.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19850922 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Liu M, Wan ZL, Chu YC, Aladdin H, Klaproth B, Choquette M, Hua QX, Mackin RB, Rao JS, De Meyts P, Katsoyannis PG, Arvan P, Weiss MA</author>\n    <category>J Biol Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19850922</guid>\n</item>	299	1258104440

To decipher these important structure-function relationships, it will be necessary to understand the structure, stability, and plasticity of the apoA-I molecule. Biophysical studies show that lipid-free apoA-I contains a large amount of alpha-helical structure but the location of this structure and its properties are not established. We used hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled with a fragmentation-separation method and mass spectrometric analysis to study human lipid-free apoA-I in its physiologically pertinent monomeric form. The acquisition of approximately 100 overlapping peptide fragments that redundantly cover the 243-residue apoA-I polypeptide made it possible to define the positions and stabilities of helical segments and to draw inferences about their interactions and dynamic properties.

Refolding on a chromatography column partially prevents formation of the intermediate form prone to aggregation. A chromatographic refolding procedure was developed using an autoprotease fusion protein with the mutant EDDIE from the N(pro) autoprotease of pestivirus. Upon refolding, self-cleavage generates a target peptide with an authentic N-terminus. The refolding process was developed using the basic 1.8-kDa peptide sSNEVi-C fused to the autoprotease EDDIE or the acidic peptide pep6His, applying cation and anion exchange chromatography, respectively. Dissolved inclusion bodies were loaded on cation exchange chromatographic resins (Capto S, POROS HS, Fractogel EMD SO(3)(-), UNOsphere S, SP Sepharose FF, CM Sepharose FF, S Ceramic HyperD F, Toyopearl SP-650, and Toyopearl MegaCap II SP-550EC). A conditioning step was introduced in order to reduce the urea concentration prior to the refolding step. Refolding was initiated by applying an elution buffer containing a high concentration of Tris-HCl plus common refolding additives. The actual refolding process occurred concurrently with the elution step and was completed in the collected fraction. With Capto S, POROS HS, and Fractogel SO(3)(-), refolding could be performed at column loadings of 50mg fusion protein/ml gel, resulting in a final eluate concentration of around 10-15mg/ml, with refolding and cleavage step yields of around 75%. The overall yield of recovered peptide reached 50%. Similar yields were obtained using the anion exchange system and the pep6His fusion peptide. This chromatographic refolding process allows processing of fusion peptides at a concentration range 10- to 100-fold higher than that observed for common refolding systems.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19854445 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Schmoeger E, Berger E, Trefilov A, Jungbauer A, Hahn R</author>\n    <category>J Chromatogr A</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19854445</guid>\n</item>	45	1258446238

In this work, the functional properties of the nine Lhca antennas of Chlamydomonas, have been investigated upon expression of the apoproteins in bacteria and refolding in vitro of the pigment-protein complexes. It is shown that all Lhca complexes have a red-shifted fluorescence emission as compared to the antenna complexes of Photosystem II, similar to Lhca from higher plants, but less red-shifted. Three complexes, namely Lhca2, Lhca4 and Lhca9, exhibit emission maxima above 707 nm and all carry an asparagine as ligand for Chl 603. The comparison of the protein sequences and the biochemical/spectroscopic properties of the refolded Chlamydomonas complexes with those of the well-characterized A. thaliana Lhcas shows that all the Chlamydomonas complexes have a chromophore organization similar to that of A. thaliana antennas, particularly to Lhca2, despite low sequence identity. All the major biochemical and spectroscopic properties of the Lhca complexes have been conserved through the evolution, including those involved in "red forms" absorption. It has been proposed that in Chlamydomonas PSI antenna size and polypeptide composition can be modulated in vivo depending on growth conditions, at variance as compared to higher plants. Thus, the different properties of the individual Lhca complexes can be functional to adapt the architecture of the PSI-LHCI supercomplex to different environmental conditions.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19853576 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Mozzo M, Mantelli M, Passarini F, Caffarri S, Croce R, Bassi R</author>\n    <category>Biochim Biophys Acta</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19853576</guid>\n</item>	11	1258446238

The mechanism of this auto-processing reaction is not yet clear but the protease activity has been shown to map to the C-terminal region of NS2 and the N-terminal serine protease region of NS3. The NS2-3 precursor can be expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies, purified as denatured protein and refolded, in the presence of detergents and the divalent metal ion zinc, into an active form capable of auto-cleavage. Here, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence has been used to assess refolding in the wild type protein and specific active site mutants. We also investigate the effects on protein folding of alterations to the reaction conditions that have been shown to prevent auto-cleavage.

Within the extracellular domain (ECD), the eponymous Cys-loop harbors two conserved cysteines, assumed to be linked by a superfamily-specific disulfide bond. The GlyR ECD carries three additional cysteine residues, two of which are predicted to form a second, GlyR-specific bond. The configuration of none of the GlyR's cysteines, however, had been determined directly. Based on a crystal structure of the nAChRalpha1 ECD, we generated a model of the human GlyRalpha1 where close proximity of the respective cysteines was consistent with the formation of both the Cys-loop and the GlyR-specific disulfide bonds. To identify native disulfide bonds, the GlyRalpha1 ECD was heterologously expressed and refolded under oxidative conditions. By MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, we detected tryptic fragments of the ECD indicative of disulfide bond formation for both pairs of cysteines, as proposed by modeling. The identity of tryptic fragments was confirmed using chemical modification of cysteine and lysine residues. As evident from circular dichroism spectroscopy, mutagenesis of single cysteines did not impair refolding of the ECD in vitro, while it led to partial or complete intracellular retention and consequently to a loss of function of full-length GlyR subunits in HEK293 cells. Our results indicate that the GlyR ECD forms both a Cys-loop and a GlyR-specific disulfide bond.

In addition, Hsp90-inhibitors have shown promise for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the accumulation of toxic denatured protein aggregates. The development of assays for the identification of novel Hsp90 inhibitors began in earnest when it became apparent that the Hsp90 inhibitors available at the time had less than ideal pharmacological properties. This review summarizes what is known about Hsp90's structure and function, its ATPase cycle, its interactions with co-chaperones and clients, and the effect of Hsp90-inhibitors on these processes. It further summarizes various high throughput assays (and secondary confirmatory assays) developed to identify new Hsp90 inhibitors from chemical libraries based on the inhibitors ability to: inhibit Hsp90's ATPase activity; compete for ligand binding to Hsp90 and its N-terminal ATP-binding domain; inhibit Hsp90-dependent refolding of denatured luciferase; and deplete culture cells of Hsp90-dependnet client protein or induce Hsp70 expression. In addition, in vitro assays are described that help determine the site of inhibitor binding to Hsp90 (N- or C-terminal domain) and there mechanism of action based on effects of inhibitors on Hsp90/ co-chaperone and client interactions, and Hsp90 conformation characterized by proteolytic fingerprinting.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19860729 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Matts RL, Manjarrez JR</author>\n    <category>Curr Top Med Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19860729</guid>\n</item>	0	1257350433

It consists of an N-terminal helix that anchors PpiD in the inner membrane near the SecYEG translocon, followed by three periplasmic domains. The second domain (residues 264-357) shows homology to parvulin-like prolyl isomerases. This domain is a well folded, stable protein and follows a simple two-state folding mechanism. In its solution structure, as determined by NMR spectroscopy, it resembles most closely the first parvulin domain of the SurA protein, which resides in the periplasm of E. coli as well. A previously reported prolyl isomerase activity of PpiD could not be reproduced when using improved protease-free peptide assays or assays with refolding proteins as substrates. The parvulin domain of PpiD interacts, however, with a proline-containing tetrapeptide, and the binding site, as identified by NMR resonance shift analysis, co-localized with the catalytic sites of other parvulins. In its structure, the parvulin domain of PpiD resembles most closely the inactive first parvulin domain of SurA, which is part of the chaperone unit of this protein and presumably involved in substrate recognition.

Under steady-state conditions, a sequential unfolding of the layers in the helix-like rod occurred at somewhat different forces, 26 pN for S(II) pili and 21 pN for S(I) pili, and there was an apparent difference in the kinetics, 1.3 and 8.8 Hz. Tests with bacteria defective in a newly recognized sfa gene (sfaX (II)) indicated that absence of the sfaX (II) gene weakens the interactions of the fimbrium slightly and decreases the kinetics. Data of S(I) are compared with those of previously assessed pili primary associated with urinary tract infections, the P and type 1 pili. S pili have weaker layer-to-layer bonds than both P and type 1 pili, 21, 28 and 30 pN, respectively. In addition, the S pili kinetics are ~10 times faster than the kinetics of P pili and ~550 times faster than the kinetics of type 1 pili.

We used force-measuring optical tweezers to characterize the intrinsic biomechanical properties and kinetics of S(II) and S(I) pili. Under steady-state conditions, a sequential unfolding of the layers in the helix-like rod occurred at somewhat different forces, 26 pN for S(II) pili and 21 pN for S(I) pili, and there was an apparent difference in the kinetics, 1.3 and 8.8 Hz. Tests with bacteria defective in a newly recognized sfa gene (sfaX (II)) indicated that absence of the sfaX (II) gene weakens the interactions of the fimbrium slightly and decreases the kinetics. Data of S(I) are compared with those of previously assessed pili primary associated with urinary tract infections, the P and type 1 pili. S pili have weaker layer-to-layer bonds than both P and type 1 pili, 21, 28 and 30 pN, respectively. In addition, the S pili kinetics are ~10 times faster than the kinetics of P pili and ~550 times faster than the kinetics of type 1 pili. Our results also show that the biomechanical properties of pili expressed ectopically from a plasmid in a laboratory strain (HB101) and pili expressed from the chromosome of a clinical isolate (IHE3034) are identical.

It consists of an N-terminal helix that anchors PpiD in the inner membrane near the SecYEG translocon, followed by three periplasmic domains. The second domain (residues 264-357) shows homology to parvulin-like prolyl isomerases. This domain is a well folded, stable protein and follows a simple two-state folding mechanism. In its solution structure, as determined by NMR spectroscopy, it resembles most closely the first parvulin domain of the SurA protein, which resides in the periplasm of E. coli as well. A previously reported prolyl isomerase activity of PpiD could not be reproduced when using improved protease-free peptide assays or assays with refolding proteins as substrates. The parvulin domain of PpiD interacts, however, with a proline-containing tetrapeptide, and the binding site, as identified by NMR resonance shift analysis, co-localized with the catalytic sites of other parvulins. In its structure, the parvulin domain of PpiD resembles most closely the inactive first parvulin domain of SurA, which is part of the chaperone unit of this protein and presumably involved in substrate recognition.

Within the extracellular domain (ECD), the eponymous Cys-loop harbors two conserved cysteines, assumed to be linked by a superfamily-specific disulfide bond. The GlyR ECD carries three additional cysteine residues, two of which are predicted to form a second, GlyR-specific bond. The configuration of none of the GlyR's cysteines, however, had been determined directly. Based on a crystal structure of the nAChRalpha1 ECD, we generated a model of the human GlyRalpha1 where close proximity of the respective cysteines was consistent with the formation of both the Cys-loop and the GlyR-specific disulfide bonds. To identify native disulfide bonds, the GlyRalpha1 ECD was heterologously expressed and refolded under oxidative conditions. By MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, we detected tryptic fragments of the ECD indicative of disulfide bond formation for both pairs of cysteines, as proposed by modeling. The identity of tryptic fragments was confirmed using chemical modification of cysteine and lysine residues. As evident from circular dichroism spectroscopy, mutagenesis of single cysteines did not impair refolding of the ECD in vitro, while it led to partial or complete intracellular retention and consequently to a loss of function of full-length GlyR subunits in HEK293 cells. Our results indicate that the GlyR ECD forms both a Cys-loop and a GlyR-specific disulfide bond. In addition, cysteine residues appear to be important for protein maturation in vivo.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19861413 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Vogel N, Kluck CJ, Melzer N, Schwarzinger S, Breitinger U, Seeber S, Becker CM</author>\n    <category>J Biol Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19861413</guid>\n</item>	17	1258699840

In addition, Hsp90-inhibitors have shown promise for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the accumulation of toxic denatured protein aggregates. The development of assays for the identification of novel Hsp90 inhibitors began in earnest when it became apparent that the Hsp90 inhibitors available at the time had less than ideal pharmacological properties. This review summarizes what is known about Hsp90's structure and function, its ATPase cycle, its interactions with co-chaperones and clients, and the effect of Hsp90-inhibitors on these processes. It further summarizes various high throughput assays (and secondary confirmatory assays) developed to identify new Hsp90 inhibitors from chemical libraries based on the inhibitors ability to: inhibit Hsp90's ATPase activity; compete for ligand binding to Hsp90 and its N-terminal ATP-binding domain; inhibit Hsp90-dependent refolding of denatured luciferase; and deplete culture cells of Hsp90-dependnet client protein or induce Hsp70 expression. In addition, in vitro assays are described that help determine the site of inhibitor binding to Hsp90 (N- or C-terminal domain) and there mechanism of action based on effects of inhibitors on Hsp90/ co-chaperone and client interactions, and Hsp90 conformation characterized by proteolytic fingerprinting.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19860729 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Matts RL, Manjarrez JR</author>\n    <category>Curr Top Med Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19860729</guid>\n</item>	0	1258699840

Viral maturation involves large-scale morphologic changes in viral proteins and in genomic RNA dimer structures to yield infectious virions. Structural studies have largely focused on simplified in vitro models of genomic RNA dimers even though the relationship between these models and authentic viral RNA is unknown. We evaluate the secondary structure of the minimal dimerization domain in genomes isolated from Moloney murine leukemia virions using a quantitative and single nucleotide resolution RNA structure analysis technology (SHAPE). Results are consistent with an architecture in which the RNA dimer is stabilized by four primary interactions involving two sets of intermolecular base pairs and two loop-loop interactions. The dimerization domain can independently direct its own folding since heating and refolding reproduces the same structure as visualized in genomic RNA isolated from virions. Authentic ex virio RNA has a SHAPE reactivity profile similar to that of a simplified-transcript dimer generated in vitro, with the important exception of a region that appears to form a compact stem-loop only in the virion-isolated RNA. Finally, we analyze the conformational changes that accompany folding of monomers into dimers in vitro. These experiments support well-defined structural models for an authentic dimerization domain and also emphasize that many features of mature genomic RNA dimers can be reproduced in vitro using properly designed, simplified RNAs.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19889760 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Gherghe C, Leonard CW, Gorelick RJ, Weeks KM</author>\n    <category>J Virol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19889760</guid>\n</item>	71	1259206725

APE1 cleaves the DNA backbone 5' to an abasic site, giving a 3'-OH primer for repair synthesis, and mediates other key repair activities. The DNA repair functions are essential for embryogenesis and cell viability. APE1-deficient cells are hypersensitive to DNA-damaging agents, and APE1 is considered an attractive target for inhibitors that could potentially enhance the efficacy of some anti-cancer agents.

The presence of disulfide bonded isomers, occurring as distinctly populated states even in the fusion protein, were separated by gel filtration chromatography. The target peptide was liberated from the host protein by Tev protease cleavage and subsequent purification was achieved using RP-HPLC methods. Reverse phase HPLC clearly showed the presence of at least two isomeric forms of the peptide that were significantly populated. The oxidative folding of BTK-2 was achieved under ambient conditions during the course of purification. Structural characterization of the two forms, by solution homonuclear and heteronuclear NMR methods, has shown that these two forms exhibit significantly different structural properties, and represent the natively folded and a "misfolded" form of the peptide.

Two recombinant Sendai viruses, F-L179V and F-K180Q, were generated that contain F protein mutations in the heptad repeat A region of the ectodomain, a region of the protein known to regulate F protein activation. In vitro, the F-L179V virus caused increased syncytium formation (cell-cell membrane fusion), yet had a rate of replication and levels of F protein expression and cleavage similar to wild-type virus. The F-K180Q virus had a reduced replication rate along with reduced levels of F protein expression, cleavage and fusogenicity. In DBA/2 mice, the hyperfusogenic F-L179V virus induced greater morbidity and mortality than wild-type virus, while the attenuated F-K180Q virus was much less pathogenic. During the first week of infection, virus replication and inflammation in the lungs was similar for wild-type and F-L179V viruses. After approximately one week of infection, the clearance of F-L179V virus was delayed and more extensive interstitial inflammation and necrosis was observed in the lungs, affecting entire lobes of the lungs and having significantly greater numbers of syncytial cell masses in alveolar spaces on day 10. On the other hand, the slower-growing F-K180Q virus caused much less extensive inflammation than wild-type virus, presumably due to its reduced replication rate, and did not cause observable syncytium formation in the lungs. Overall, the results show that residues in the heptad repeat A region of the F protein modulate the virulence of Sendai virus in mice by influencing both the spread and clearance of the virus and the extent and severity of inflammation. An understanding of how the F protein contributes to infection and inflammation in vivo may assist in the development of antiviral therapies against respiratory paramyxoviruses.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19906935 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Luque LE, Bridges OA, Mason JN, Boyd KL, Portner A, Russell CJ</author>\n    <category>J Virol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19906935</guid>\n</item>	22	1259922885

Refolding of the F protein from a metastable conformation to a highly stable post-fusion form is critical for the promotion of fusion although the mechanism is still not well understood. Here we examined the effects of mutations of individual residues of the F protein of Newcastle Disease Virus located at critical regions of the protein, such as the C-terminus of the N-terminal heptad repeat (HRA) and the N-terminus of the C-terminal heptad repeat (HRB). Seven of the mutants were expressed at the cell surface, showing differences in antibody reactivity in comparison with the F wild-type. Mutants N211A, L461A, I463A and I463F showed a hyperfusogenic phenotype both in syncitium and in dye-transfer assays. The four mutants promoted fusion more efficiently at lower temperatures than the wild type, meaning probably lower energy requirements for activation. Moreover, mutants N211A, I463A and I463F exhibited haemagglutinin-neuraminidase(HN)-independent activity when influenza haemagglutinin (HA) was coexpressed as an attachment protein.

We illustrate the complexity of the folding kinetics and generic aspects of the collapse of RNA and proteins upon force quench by using simulations of an RNA hairpin and theory based on the de Gennes model for homopolymer collapse. The folding time, tau(F), depends asymmetrically on delta f(S) = f(S) - f(m) and delta f(Q) = f(m) - f(Q) where f(S) (f(Q)) is the stretch (quench) force and f(m) is the transition midforce of the RNA hairpin. In accord with experiments, the relaxation kinetics of the molecular extension, R(t), occurs in three stages: A rapid initial decrease in the extension is followed by a plateau and finally, an abrupt reduction in R(t) occurs as the native state is approached. The duration of the plateau increases as lambda =tau(Q)/tau(F) decreases (where tau(Q) is the time in which the force is reduced from f(S) to f(Q)). Variations in the mechanisms of force-quench relaxation as lambda is altered are reflected in the experimentally measurable time-dependent entropy, which is computed directly from the folding trajectories. An analytical solution of the de Gennes model under tension reproduces the multistage stage kinetics in R(t). The prediction that the initial stages of collapse should also be a generic feature of polymers is validated by simulation of the kinetics of toroid (globule) formation in semiflexible (flexible) homopolymers in poor solvents upon quenching the force from a fully stretched state.

CYT-18 binds the core along the same surface as a common peripheral element, P5abc, suggesting that CYT-18 can replace P5abc functionally. In addition to stabilizing structure generally, P5abc stabilizes the native conformation of the Tetrahymena group I intron relative to a globally-similar misfolded conformation, which has only local differences within the core and is populated significantly at equilibrium by a ribozyme variant lacking P5abc (E(DeltaP5abc)). Here we show that CYT-18 specifically promotes formation of the native group I intron core from this misfolded conformation. Catalytic activity assays demonstrate that CYT-18 shifts the equilibrium of E(DeltaP5abc) toward the native state by at least 35-fold, and binding assays suggest an even larger effect. Thus, like P5abc, CYT-18 preferentially recognizes the native core, despite the global similarity of the misfolded core and despite forming crudely similar complexes, as revealed by DMS footprinting. Interestingly, the effects of CYT-18 and P5abc on folding kinetics differ. Whereas P5abc inhibits refolding of the misfolded conformation by forming peripheral contacts that must break during refolding, CYT-18 does not display analogous inhibition, most likely because it relies to a greater extent on direct interactions with the core. Although CYT-18 does not encounter this RNA in vivo, our results suggest that it stabilizes its cognate group I introns relative to analogous misfolded intermediates. By specifically recognizing native structure, CYT-18 may also interact with earlier folding intermediates to avoid RNA misfolding or to trap native structure as it forms. More generally, our results highlight the ability of a protein cofactor to stabilize a functional RNA structure specifically without incurring associated costs in RNA folding kinetics.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19913030 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Chadee AB, Bhaskaran H, Russell R</author>\n    <category>J Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19913030</guid>\n</item>	33	1261468901

Constructs were designed for cytoplasmic production of N. kaouthia "weak" toxin in the form of a fused polypeptide chain with thioredoxin and for secretion with the leader peptide STII.

Several prolyl isomerases of the FK506-binding protein family, such as trigger factor, SlyD, and FkpA, contain chaperone domains and are assumed to assist protein folding in vivo. The prolyl isomerase activity of FK506-binding proteins strongly depends on the nature of residue Xaa of the Xaa-Pro bond. We confirmed this in assays with a library of tetrapeptides in which position Xaa was occupied by all 20 aa. A high sequence specificity seems inconsistent with a generic function of prolyl isomerases in protein folding. Accordingly, we constructed a library of protein variants with all 20 aa at position Xaa before a rate-limiting cis proline and used it to investigate the performance of trigger factor and SlyD as catalysts of proline-limited folding. The efficiencies of both prolyl isomerases were higher than in the tetrapeptide assays, and, intriguingly, this high activity was almost independent of the nature of the residue before the proline. Apparently, the almost indiscriminate binding of the chaperone domain to the refolding protein chain overrides the inherently high sequence specificity of the prolyl isomerase site. The catalytic performance of these folding enzymes is thus determined by generic substrate recognition at the chaperone domain and efficient transfer to the active site in the prolyl isomerase domain.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19920179 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Jakob RP, ZoldÃ¡k G, AumÃ¼ller T, Schmid FX</author>\n    <category>Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19920179</guid>\n</item>	6	1261468901

In this study, we have demonstrated for the first time that a prefoldin from hyper thermophilic archaeon, Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 (PhPFD), exhibits refolding activity for denatured lysozyme at temperatures relatively lower than physiologically active temperatures. The interaction between PhPFD and denatured lysozyme was investigated by use of a surface plasmon resonance sensor at various temperatures. Although PhPFD showed strong affinity for denatured lysozyme at high temperature, it exhibited relatively weak interactions at lower temperature. The protein folding seems to occur through binding and release from PhPFD by virtue of the weak affinity. Our results also imply that that prefoldin might be able to contribute to the folding of some cellular proteins whose affinity with prefoldin is weak.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19919829 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Zako T, Banba S, Sahlan M, Sakono M, Terada N, Yohda M, Maeda M</author>\n    <category>Biochem Biophys Res Commun</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19919829</guid>\n</item>	5	1261468901

METHODS: The 732 bp DNA sequence of hLINGO-1(aa76-319) was obtained from pCMV-SPORT6 by PCR and inserted into pET30a(+) plasmid to construct the prokaryotic expression plasmid pET30a(+)-hLINGO-1(aa76-319), which was subsequently transformed into E.coli. The target fusion protein was expressed with IPTG induction and purified by Ni(2+)-NTA affinity chromatography column. The antiserum against hLINGO-1(aa76-319) was obtained from the rabbits immunized with hLINGO-1(aa76-319), and the titer of the pAb was determined using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and its specificity identified using Western blotting. RESULTS: The prokaryotic expression plasmid pET30a(+)-hLINGO-1(aa76-319) was constructed successfully. Efficient expression of the target fusion protein was achieved with IPTG induction at the optimal concentration of 0.4 mmol/L and culture temperature at 37 degrees celsius; for 2.5 h. The hLINGO-1(aa76-319) fusion protein was effectively expressed in E.coli as inclusion bodies, and the soluble protein was obtained through denaturation and refolding procedures, and the purified fusion protein showed a purity above 90%.

METHODS: Forty-three recombinant proteins performing important biological functions were expressed in E. coli. The probability of forming inclusion bodies of these proteins was predicted using Harrison's two parameter prediction model based on the proteins' amino acid composition. Subsequently, the proteins from the inclusion bodies were refolded using a double denaturation method that involved washing and denaturation in GdnHCl solution followed by denaturation in Urea solution and refolding through dilution. RESULTS: All the proteins were detected in the form of inclusion bodies using SDS-PAGE method. The proteins were divided into two types according to the results of both solubility prediction and refolding experiments. Fourteen proteins were predicted to have the dependency of soluble expression. The refolding yields of these inclusion bodies were up to 70%. Twenty-nine proteins were predicted to have the high dependency of insoluble expression, and their refolding yields could be higher than 70% and lower than 60%. Comparison of the characteristics between the proteins with high and low refolding yields showed that the theoretical pI was significantly different (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Harrison's two parameter prediction model has the value for potential application in classification of the inclusion bodies and prediction of solubility of proteins refolded from different inclusion bodies.

We now face a high risk of simultaneous exposure to heat and oxidative stress. However, there have been few studies investigating their combined adverse effects on cell viability. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Pretreatment of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) specifically and highly sensitized cells to heat stress, and enhanced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. H(2)O(2) exposure impaired the HSP40/HSP70 induction as heat shock response (HSR) and the unfolded protein recovery, and enhanced eIF2alpha phosphorylation and/or XBP1 splicing, land marks of ER stress. These H(2)O(2)-mediated effects mimicked enhanced heat sensitivity in HSF1 knockdown or knockout cells. Importantly, thermal preconditioning blocked H(2)O(2)-mediated inhibitory effects on refolding activity and rescued HSF1 +/+ MEFs, but neither blocked the effects nor rescued HSF1 -/- MEFs. These data strongly suggest that inhibition of HSR and refolding activity is crucial for H(2)O(2)-mediated enhanced heat sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: H(2)O(2) blocks HSR and refolding activity under heat stress, thereby leading to insufficient quality control and enhancing ER stress. These uncontrolled stress responses may enhance cell death. Our data thus highlight oxidative stress as a crucial factor affecting heat tolerance.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19936221 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Adachi M, Liu Y, Fujii K, Calderwood SK, Nakai A, Imai K, Shinomura Y</author>\n    <category>PLoS One</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19936221</guid>\n</item>	1	1261468900

However, mammalian derived Epo has low yields and high costs of production. In this article, a cost-effective strategy of producing non-glycosylated Epo from E. coli and then PEGylating it to replace the role of sugar chains was investigated. Recombinant human non-glycosylated erythropoietin (rh-ngEpo) was overexpressed as inclusion body in E. coli. As the routine inclusion body washing step resulted in poor protein recovery and purity, a new process scheme of using strong ion-exchange chromatography to purify denatured rh-ngEpo from inclusion body before refolding was developed. The purity of the denatured rh-ngEpo was increased from 59% to over 90%. Rh-ngEpo was then refolded and subsequently purified by one step of weak cation-exchange chromatography to 98% pure. Final protein yield was 129mg/l, a significant improvement from 49mg/l obtained via the conventional practice. The in vitro bioactivity of purified rh-ngEpo was comparable with the CHO-expressed Epo and the formation of native secondary structure was also confirmed by CD spectra. Rh-ngEpo was then modified by a 20kDa methoxy polyethylene glycol (PEG) succinimidyl carbonate. The monoPEGylated protein, which retained 68% bioactivity, had enhanced thermal stability and a remarkably prolonged circulating half-life in rats as compared with that of the unmodified protein. These studies demonstrated the feasibility of PEGylating rh-ngEpo as a promising way for the development of new Epo drugs.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19932158 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Wang YJ, Liu YD, Chen J, Hao SJ, Hu T, Ma GH, Su ZG</author>\n    <category>Int J Pharm</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19932158</guid>\n</item>	49	1261468900

However, gB alone is insufficient for membrane fusion; the gH/gL heterodimer is also required. The crystal structure of the HSV-1 gB ectodomain, gB730, has shown similarities between gB and other viral fusion proteins, leading to the hypothesis that gB is a fusogen, presumably directly involved in bringing the membranes together by refolding from its initial, or prefusion form, to its final, or postfusion form. The only available crystal structure likely represents the postfusion form of gB; the prefusion form has not yet been determined. Previously, a panel of HSV-1 gB mutants was generated using random 5-amino-acid-linker insertion mutagenesis. Several mutants were unable to mediate cell-cell fusion despite being expressed on the cell surface. Mapping of the insertion sites onto the crystal structure of gB730 suggested that several insertions might not be accommodated in the postfusion form. Thus, we hypothesized that some insertion mutants were non-functional due to being "trapped" in a prefusion form. Here, we generated five insertion mutants as soluble ectodomains and characterized them biochemically. We show that the ectodomains of all five mutants assume conformations similar to that of the wild-type gB730. Four mutants have biochemical properties and overall structures that are indistinguishable from those of the wild-type gB730. We conclude that these mutants undergo only minor local conformational changes to relieve the steric strain resulting from the presence of 5 extra amino acids. Interestingly, one mutant, while able to adopt the overall postfusion structure, displays significant conformational differences in the vicinity of fusion loops, relative to wild-type gB730. Moreover, this mutant has a diminished ability to associate with liposomes, suggesting that the fusion loops in this mutant have decreased functional activity. We propose that these insertions cause a fusion-null phenotype not by preventing conversion of gB to a postfusion-like conformation, but rather by interfering with other gB functions.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19939928 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Silverman JL, Sharma S, Cairns TM, Heldwein EE</author>\n    <category>J Virol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19939928</guid>\n</item>	1	1261468900

Chaperones are important players in the aging process as they prevent protein misfolding and aggregation. Small chaperones such as small heat shock proteins are involved in the refolding and/or disposal of protein aggregates, a feature of many age-associated diseases. In Drosophila melanogaster, mitochondrial Hsp22 (DmHsp22), is localized in the mitochondrial matrix and is preferentially up-regulated during aging. Its over-expression results in an extension of life span (&gt;30%)(Morrow et al FASEB J. 18, 598-599, 2004 and J. Biol. Chem. 279, 43382-43385, 2004). Long-lived flies expressing Hsp22 also have an increased resistance to oxidative stress and maintain locomotor activity longer. In the present study, the cross-species effects of Hsp22 expression were tested. DmHsp22 was found to be functionally active in human cells. It extended the life span of normal fibroblasts, slowing the aging process as evidenced by a lower level of the senescence associated beta-galactosidase. DmHsp22 expression in human cancer cells increased their malignant properties including anchorage independent growth, tumor formation in nude mice and resistance to a variety of anticancer drugs. We report that the DmHsp22 interacts and inactivates wild type tumor suppressor protein p53 which may be one possible way of its functioning in human cells.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19948727 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Wadhwa R, Ryu J, Gao R, Choi IK, Morrow G, Kaur K, Kim I, Kaul SC, Yun CO, Tanguay RM</author>\n    <category>J Biol Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19948727</guid>\n</item>	51	1261471811

While progress has been made for mechanistic understanding of the effects of arginine on proteins, we have little understanding on how arginine inactivates viruses. One of the viral components is nucleic acid. We have examined the effects of arginine on the structure and thermal stability of calf thymus deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) using circular dichroism (CD). Both NaCl and arginine reduced CD intensity. At low concentrations, arginine showed a stronger effect on CD intensity than NaCl. Both NaCl and arginine sharply increased the melting temperature at low concentrations (below 0.25M). However, they had an opposite effect at higher concentrations. Above this concentration, NaCl gradually increased the melting temperature, leading to the onset melting temperature above 90 C. On the other hand, the thermal stability in the presence of arginine reached a maximum at 0.2-0.5M, after which further addition of arginine caused decreased melting temperature. It is most likely that the increased melting temperature at low concentration is due to electrostatic stabilization of DNA structure by both NaCl and arginine and that the opposite effects at higher salt concentration are due to salt-specific effects, i.e., stabilizing (salting-out) effects of NaCl and destabilizing (salting-in) effects of arginine. Solubility measurements of nucleic acid bases showed that arginine, but not NaCl, increases the solubilities of the bases, supporting their effects on DNA stability at higher concentration.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19948185 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Arakawa T, Hirano A, Shiraki K, Kita Y, Koyama AH</author>\n    <category>Int J Biol Macromol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19948185</guid>\n</item>	1	1261471811

Furthermore HA-derived cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes are relatively rare in comparison to other internal gene products. Here CTL epitopes of the HA serotype H5 protein were screened. Using in silico prediction, in vitro refolding and a T2 cell binding assay, followed by immunization of HLA-A2.1/Kb transgenic mice, an HLA-A*0201-restricted decameric epitope, RI-10 (H5 HA205-214, RLYQNPTTYI), was shown to elicit a robust CTL-epitope specific response. In addition, RI-10 and its variant, KI-10 (KLYQNPTTYI), were also demonstrated to be able to induce a higher CTL-epitope specific response than the influenza A virus dominant CTL epitope GL-9 (GILGFVFTL) in PBMCs of HLA-A*0201-positive patients recovered from H5N1 virus infection. Furthermore, the crystal structures of RI-10-HLA-A*0201 and KI-10-HLA-A*0201 complexes were determined at 2.3 A and 2.2 A resolution, respectively, showing typical HLA-A*0201-restricted epitopes. The conformations of RI-10 and KI-10 in the antigen presenting grooves in crystal structures of the two complexes show significant difference despite of their nearly identical sequences.

The potential of small peptides derived from precursor food proteins, to bind to partly unfolded stressed proteins to prevent their irreversible aggregation and inactivation has been demonstrated in various in vitro test systems: dithiothreitol-induced aggregation of alpha-lactalbumin (LA), heat-induced aggregation of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), and aggregation and inactivation of bovine erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase (CA) in the process of its refolding after removal of stress conditions. Using dynamic light scattering (DLS), turbidimetry, fluorescence, and circular dichroism measurements protective effects of the synthetic opioid peptides: exorphin C from wheat gluten (Tyr-Pro-Ile-Ser-Leu), rubiscolin-5 from spinach ribulose-bisphosphate-carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) (Tyr-Pro-Leu-Asp-Leu), and hemorphin-6 from bovine hemoglobin (Tyr-Pro-Trp-Thr-Gln-Arg) have been revealed. We have demonstrated the concentration-dependent suppression of light scattering intensity of aggregates of LA and ADH in the presence of the peptides, the population of nanoparticles with higher hydrodynamic radii being shifted to the lower ones, accompanied by an increase in the lag period of aggregation. The presence of the peptides in the refolding solution was shown to assist reactivation of CA and enhance the yield of the CA soluble protein. The results suggest that bioactive food protein fragments may be regarded as exogenous supplements to the endogenous defense mechanisms of the human organism under stress conditions.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 19954758 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Artemova NV, Bumagina ZM, Kasakov AS, Shubin VV, Gurvits BY</author>\n    <category>Peptides</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:19954758</guid>\n</item>	14	1261471810

Here we show that the in vitro refolding of a representative molecular chaperone, DnaK, an E. coli homolog of Hsp70, could be assisted by its interacting 5S rRNA. The folding enhancement occurred in RNA concentration and its size dependent manner whereas neither the RNA with the reverse sequence of 5S rRNA nor the RNase pretreated 5S rRNA stimulated the folding in vitro. Based on our results, we propose that 5S rRNA could exert the chaperoning activity on DnaK during the folding process.

In this respect, previous studies on the W60G beta2m mutant showing that the lack of W60 prevents fibril formation in mild aggregating condition, prompted us to re-investigate the refolding kinetics of wild-type and W60G beta2m at atomic resolution by real-time NMR. The analysis, conducted at ambient temperature by the band Selective Flip Angle Short Transient (SOFAST) real-time 2D NMR techniques and probing the beta2m states every 15s, revealed a more complex folding energy landscape than previously reported for wild-type beta2m, involving more than a single intermediate species, and shedding new light into the fibrillogenic pathway.

Here we report systematic characterization of a new two-domain peptide (named MeuTXKbeta1) belonging to the TsTXKbeta molecular subfamily from the scorpion Mesobuthus eupeus by molecular cloning, biochemical purification, recombinant expression, functional assays, CD and NMR studies. Its full-length bioactive form as well as 1-21 and 22-72 fragments (named N(1-21) and C(22-72), respectively) were produced in Escherichia coli by an on-column refolding approach. Recombinant peptide (rMeuTXKbeta1) exhibited a low affinity for K(+) channels and cytolytic effects against bacteria and several eukaryotic cells. N(1-21) was found to preserve anti-Plasmodium activity in contrast to haemolytic activity, whereas C(22-72) retains these two activities. Circular dichroism analysis demonstrates that rMeuTXKbeta1 presents a typical scorpion toxin scaffold in water and its alpha-helical content largely increases in a membrane-mimicking environment, consistent with the NMR structure of N(1-21) and an ab initio structure model of MeuTXKbeta1 predicted using I-TASSER algorithm. Our structural and functional data clearly indicate an evolutionary link between TsTXKbeta-related peptides and antiparasitic scorpines which both comprise the betaSPN (beta-KTxs and scorpines) family.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20045493 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Zhu S, Gao B, Aumelas A, RodrÃ­guez MD, Lanz-Mendoza H, Peigneur S, Diego-Garcia E, Martin-Eauclaire MF, Tytgat J, Possani LD</author>\n    <category>Biochim Biophys Acta</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20045493</guid>\n</item>	10	1264222006

Here, I show that approximately 25% of a large panel of neutralizing monoclonal Abs (mAbs), including Abs specific for each of the four major antigenic sites, can bind to completely denatured HA. Binding of these mAbs to denatured HA occurs much more slowly than binding to native HA, but bound mAbs dissociate from denatured and native HA with similar kinetics, and amino acid substitutions that reduce mAb binding to native HA have a similar effect on mAb interaction with denatured HA. HA refolding induced by mAb binding facilitated the binding of mAbs to other antigenic sites, indicating that refolding was not limited to the antibody-interaction domain. These findings validate the localization of antigenic sites by identifying amino acid substitutions selected in mAb escape mutants. Further, they demonstrate that Abs can facilitate the refolding of denatured proteins, which suggests a number of practical applications for optimizing antibody based assays, and also for potentially using Abs as specific chaperones for protein refolding.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20047763 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Yewdell JW</author>\n    <category>Mol Immunol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20047763</guid>\n</item>	30	1264491192

Employing C. elegans expressing GFP-tagged luciferase as a reporter for evaluation of protein stability we show that the chaperoning strategy of body wall muscle cells and neurons is significantly different and that both are differently affected by aging. Muscle cells of young worms are largely resistant to heat stress, which is directly mediated by the stress response controlled through Heat Shock Transcription Factor 1. During recovery following heat stress the ability to refold misfolded proteins is missing. Young neurons are highly susceptible to chronic heat stress, but show a high potency to refold or disaggregate proteins during subsequent recovery. The particular proteome instability in neurons results from a delayed induction of the heat shock response. In aged neurons protein stability is increased during heat stress, whereas muscle cells show enhanced protein instability due to a deteriorated heat shock response. An efficient refolding activity is absent in both aged tissues. These results provide molecular insights into the differential protein stabilization capacity in different tissues and during aging.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20052290 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Kern A, Ackermann B, Clement AM, Duerk H, Behl C</author>\n    <category>PLoS One</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20052290</guid>\n</item>	4	1264491191

In this work we describe the identification and optimization of a human scFv scaffold, termed FW1.4 that is suitable for humanization and stabilization of a broad variety of rabbit antibody variable domains. A motif consisting of five structurally relevant framework residues that are highly conserved in rabbit variable domains was introduced into FW1.4 to generate a generically applicable scFv scaffold, termed FW1.4gen. Grafting of complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from 15 different rabbit monoclonal antibodies onto FW1.4 and derivatives thereof, resulted in humanized scFvs with binding affinities in the range from 4.7 x 10-9 M to 1.5 x 10-11 M. Interestingly, minimalistic grafting of CDRs onto FW1.4gen, without any substitutions in the framework regions, resulted in affinities ranging from 5.7 x 10-10 M to &lt;1.8 x 10-12 M. When compared to progenitor rabbit scFvs, affinities of most humanized scFvs were similar. Moreover, in contrast to progenitor scFvs, which were difficult to produce, biophysical properties of the humanized scFvs were significantly improved, as exemplified by generally good production yields in a generic refolding process, and by apparent melting temperatures between 53 and 86 degree C. Thus, minimalistic grafting of rabbit CDRs on the FW1.4gen scaffold presents a simple and reproducible approach to humanize and stabilize rabbit variable domains.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20056614 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Borras L, Gunde T, Tietz J, Bauer U, Hulmann-Cottier V, Grimshaw JP, Urech DM</author>\n    <category>J Biol Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20056614</guid>\n</item>	18	1264499557

Unlike most retrotranslocation substrates, the A1-chain escapes degradation by the proteasome and refolds in the cytosol to induce disease. How this occurs remains poorly understood. Here, we show that an unstructured peptide appended to the N-terminus of the A1-chain renders the toxin functionally inactive. Cleavage of the peptide extension prior to cell entry rescues toxin half-life and function. The loss of toxicity is explained by rapid degradation by the proteasome after retro-translocation to the cytosol. Degradation of the mutant toxin does not follow the N-end rule but depends on the two Lys at positions 4 and 17 of the native A1-chain, consistent with poly-ubiquitination at these sites. Thus, retro-translocation and refolding of the wild-type A1-chain must proceed in a way that protects these Lys residues from attack by E3 ligases.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20056601 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Wernick NL, De Luca H, Kam WR, Lencer WI</author>\n    <category>J Biol Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20056601</guid>\n</item>	307	1264586838

It is not clearly established as to why apo-protein binds with GroEL. In order to explore the possibility, that stability is a factor responsible for the aggregation of apo-form at low ionic strengths and hence it associates with GroEL to avoid the unfavorable event, we carried out the unfolding studies with holo- and apo-aconitase. By probing the unfolding process through the changes in secondary structural element, exposed surface hydrophobicity, and the microenvironment around tryptophan residues, we were able to establish the relevant changes associated with the event. Apparent guanidine hydrochloride concentration required for unfolding of 50% of aconitase indicates that aconitase is destabilized in the absence of the Fe(4)S(4) cluster. The destabilization of the apo-aconitase was further reflected through its three times higher rate of unfolding as compared to the holo-protein. It was also observed that the apo-form has higher surface hydrophobicity than the holo-form. Hence, the lower ground state stability and higher solvent exposed hydrophobic surface of the apo-form makes it aggregation prone. Based on the present observation and earlier findings, we propose that binding of apo-aconitase to GroEL not only rescues it from the aggregation, but also assists in the final stage of maturation by orienting the cluster insertion site of GroEL bound apo-protein. This information sheds new light on the potential role of GroEL in the biosynthetic pathway of the metallo proteins.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20060926 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Gupta P, Mishra S, Chaudhuri TK</author>\n    <category>Int J Biochem Cell Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20060926</guid>\n</item>	13	1264581509

However, drug design requires high-resolution structural information and detailed biophysical knowledge not available for PchP. An obstacle in the study of PchP is that current methods for its expression and purification are suboptimal and allowed only a preliminary kinetic characterization of the enzyme. Herein, we describe a new procedure for the efficient preparation of recombinant PchP overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The enzyme is purified from urea solubilized inclusion bodies and refolded by dialysis. The product of PchP refolding is a mixture of native PchP and a kinetically-trapped, alternatively-folded aggregate that is very slowly converted into the native state. The properly folded and fully active enzyme is isolated from the refolding mixture by size-exclusion chromatography. PchP prepared by the new procedure was subjected to chemical and biophysical characterization, and its basic optical, hydrodynamic, metal-binding, and catalytic properties are reported. The unfolding of the enzyme was also investigated, and its thermal stability was determined. The obtained information should help to compare PchP with other phosphatases and to obtain a better understanding of its catalytic mechanism. In addition, preliminary trials showed that PchP prepared by the new protocol is suitable for crystallization, opening the way for high-resolution studies of the enzyme structure.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20064618 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Beassoni PR, Berti FP, Otero LH, Risso VA, Ferreyra RG, Lisa AT, Domenech CE, ErmÃ¡cora MR</author>\n    <category>Protein Expr Purif</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20064618</guid>\n</item>	8	1265106956

(1992) Science 258, 466-468)]. Later several multi-domain PPI s have been demonstrated to work as both a peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase and a chaperone. However, the chaperone ability of Cyp18 has been debated. In this work, we add additional results that show that Cyp18 can both accelerate the rate of refolding and increase the yield of native protein during the folding reaction, i.e. both function as a folding catalyst and a chaperone. Refolding experiments were performed using severely destabilized mutants of human carbonic anhydrase II under conditions where the unfolding reaction is significant and a larger fraction of a more destabilized variant populates molten-globule like intermediates during refolding. A correlation of native state protein stability of the substrate protein versus Cyp18 chaperone activity was demonstrated. The induced correction of misfolded conformations by Cyp18 likely functions through rescue from misfolding of transient molten globule intermediates. ANS binding data suggest that the interaction by Cyp18 leads to an early stage condensation of accessible hydrophobic portions of the misfolding-prone protein substrate during folding. The opposite effect was observed for GroEL known as an unfoldase at early stages of refolding. The chaperone effect of Cyp18 was also demonstrated for citrate synthtase suggesting a general chaperone effect of this PPI.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20070121 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Moparthi SB, Fristedt R, Mishra R, Almstedt K, Karlsson M, Hammarstrom P, Carlsson U</author>\n    <category>Biochemistry</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20070121</guid>\n</item>	2	1265253302

This presents a challenge to chaperones that are localized to ATP-deficient cellular compartments. Here we describe a mechanism by which the pH-regulated acid stress chaperone HdeA is capable of independently facilitating the refolding of acid-denatured proteins in the bacterial periplasm, which lacks both ATP and ATP-dependent chaperone machines. Our results are consistent with a model in which HdeA stably binds substrates at low pH, thereby preventing their irreversible aggregation. pH neutralization subsequently triggers the slow release of substrate proteins from HdeA, keeping the concentration of aggregation-sensitive intermediates below the threshold where they begin to aggregate. This provides a straightforward and ATP-independent mechanism that allows HdeA to facilitate protein refolding. Unlike previously characterized chaperones, HdeA appears to facilitate protein folding by using a single substrate binding-release cycle. This cycle is entirely regulated by the external environment and is therefore energy-neutral for the bacteria.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20080625 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Tapley TL, Franzmann TM, Chakraborty S, Jakob U, Bardwell JC</author>\n    <category>Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20080625</guid>\n</item>	1	1265346780

Diphtheria toxin-stem cell factor (DT-SCF) is one such novel fusion toxin designed to target malignancies expressing c-kit. Since, c-kit overexpression has been reported on many types of cancers, it appeared to be a reasonably good molecule to target. In the present study, we report construction, expression, purification, and characterization of DT-SCF. DT-SCF gene coding for 1-387 amino acids of diphtheria toxin, His-Ala linker, 2-141 amino acids of SCF was cloned into expression vector with C terminal His tag. The induced DT-SCF protein was exclusively expressed in insoluble fraction. Purification of DT-SCF was achieved by inclusion body isolation and metal affinity chromatography under denaturing and reducing conditions. Purified DT-SCF was renatured partially on-column by gradually reducing denaturant concentration followed by complete refolding through rapid dilution technique. Cell viability assay provided the evidence that DT-SCF is a potent cytotoxic agent selective to cells expressing c-kit. The novelty of this study lies in employing SCF as a ligand in construction of fusion toxin to target wide range of malignancies expressing c-kit. Efficacy of DT-SCF fusion toxin was demonstrated over a range of malignancies such as chronic myeloid leukemia (K562), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (MOLT4), pancreatic carcinoma (PANC-1), and cervical carcinoma (HeLa 229). This is the first study reporting specificity and efficacy of DT-SCF against tumor cells expressing c-kit. There was significant correlation (P = 0.007) between c-kit expression on cells and their sensitivity to DT-SCF fusion toxin.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20084469 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Potala S, Verma RS</author>\n    <category>Appl Biochem Biotechnol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20084469</guid>\n</item>	85	1265340818

We have previously demonstrated that upon modification by a metabolic alpha-dicarbonyl compound, methylglyoxal (MGO), alphaA-crystallin becomes a better chaperone. Alpha A-crystallin also assists in refolding of denatured proteins. Here, we have investigated the effect of mild modification of alphaA-crystallin by MGO (with 20-500microM) on the chaperone function and its ability to refold denatured proteins. Under the conditions used, mildly modified protein contained mostly hydroimidazolone modifications. The modified protein exhibited an increase in chaperone function against thermal aggregation of beta(L)- and gamma-crystallins, citrate synthase (CS), malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and chemical aggregation of insulin. The ability of the protein to assist in refolding of chemically denatured beta(L)- and gamma-crystallins, MDH and LDH, and to prevent thermal inactivation of CS were unchanged after mild modification by MGO. Prior binding of catalytically inactive, thermally denatured MDH or the hydrophobic probe, 2-p-toluidonaphthalene-6-sulfonate (TNS) abolished the ability of alphaA-crystallin to assist in the refolding of denatured MDH. However, MGO-modification of chaperone-null TNS-bound alphaA-crystallin resulted in partial regain of the chaperone function. Taken together, these results demonstrate that: 1) hydroimidazolone modifications are sufficient to enhance the chaperone function of alphaA-crystallin but such modifications do not change its ability to assist in refolding of denatured proteins, 2) the sites on the alphaA-crystallin responsible for the chaperone function and refolding are the same in the native alphaA-crystallin and 3) additional hydrophobic sites exposed upon MGO modification, which are responsible for the enhanced chaperone function, do not enhance alphaA-crystallin's ability to refold denatured proteins.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20085807 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Gangadhariah MH, Wang B, Linetsky M, Henning C, Spanneberg R, Glomb MA, Nagaraj RH</author>\n    <category>Biochim Biophys Acta</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20085807</guid>\n</item>	42	1265340818

Ribonuclease A (RNase A) is a monomeric protein that may form several oligomers by 3D domain swapping of its N-terminal alpha-helix, C-terminal beta-strand, or both. RNase A oligomerization is induced by 40% acetic acid, which has been assumed to mildly unfold the protein by detaching the terminal segments and consequently facilitating intersubunit swapping, once the acetic acid is removed by lyophilization and the protein is redissolved in a benign buffer. Using UV difference, near UV circular dichroism, folding kinetics, and multidimensional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy, the conformation of RNase A in 40% acetic acid and in 8 M urea has been characterized. These studies demonstrate that RNase A is chiefly unfolded in 40% acetic acid; it partially retains the native helices, whereas the beta-sheet is fully denatured and all X-Pro peptide bonds are predominantly in the trans conformation. Refolding occurs via an intermediate, I(N), with non-native X-Pro peptide bonds. I(N) is known to be populated during RNase A refolding following denaturation in concentrated solutions of urea or guanidinium chloride, and we find that urea- or GdmCl-denatured RNase A can oligomerize during refolding. By revealing the importance of a chiefly denaturated state and a refolding intermediate with non-native X-Pro peptide bonds, these findings revise the model for RNase A oligomerization via 3D domain swapping and have general implications for amyloid formation.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20085318 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> LoÌpez-Alonso JP, Bruix M, Font J, RiboÌ M, Vilanova M, JimeÌnez MA, Santoro J, GonzaÌlez C, Laurents DV</author>\n    <category>J Am Chem Soc</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20085318</guid>\n</item>	17	1265701992

Here we report the expression and characterization of recombinant human plasma RBP4 using the Pichia pastoris expression system. Simple and rapid purification allowed us to obtain 5 mg/L of purified protein from the fermentation supernatant with no need to perform denaturing and refolding steps. The identity of the protein was verified by ion trap MS and Western blotting. The functionality of recombinant RBP4, i.e., the binding to its physiologic ligand, retinol, and the interaction with transthyretin (TTR), was tested by fluorimetric and pull-down assays, respectively. The apparent dissociation constant for retinol to the recombinant protein of 2 x 10(-7) M was consistent with published data for native human protein.

Here, we report identification and characterization of defensins in the parasitic wasp Nasonia (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae). In comparison with those in the non-parasitic insect Apis mellifera, two different subtypes of defensins (defensin1 and defensin2) have undergone independent gene duplication to create a mutigene family of five members (named 1-1, 1-2, 2-1, 2-2 and 2-3) in the Nasonia lineage. Such duplication occurred before the divergence of three sibling species (N. vitripennis, N. giraulti and N. longicornis) and the duplicated genes was subsequently subjected to positive selection at the amino-terminal loop and the gamma-core region. RT-PCR identified that only the subtype 1 of defensins were constitutively expressed in the N. vitripennis adult stage and none of the five defensins was expressed in other developmental stages (i.e. the infected Musca domestica pupae). A functional form of 2-2 in N. vitripennis (named navidefensin2-2) was produced in Escherichia coli by an on-column refolding approach. The recombinant peptide presented a typical defensin structure, as identified by CD analysis, and selectively inhibited the growth of two Gram(+) bacteria at low micromolar concentrations. The bioactive surface responsible for antibacterial activity of navidefensin2-2 was identified in the gamma-core region of this molecule. Positive selection targeting the antibacterial region of defensins could be a consequence of evolutionary arms race between Nasonia and its pathogens.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20097222 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Gao B, Zhu S</author>\n    <category>Dev Comp Immunol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20097222</guid>\n</item>	3	1266305855

From changes in the fluorescence spectra with time of renaturation, it can be concluded that a folding intermediate with native-like structure, but which is still inactive and sensitive to autoproteolysis, is rapidly formed after renaturation has initiated. The critical region 56-69 of pWT is involved in the autoproteolytic sensitivity of the intermediate as we conclude from the differences in the chevron plots of the first-order rate constants of reactivation and the fragmentation patterns in SDS-PAGE of pWT and G8C/N60C.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20096501 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> DÃ¼rrschmidt P, Mansfeld J, Ulbrich-Hofmann R</author>\n    <category>Biophys Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20096501</guid>\n</item>	33	1266485067

While the crevice is suggested to provide a protective space over the peptide exit site of ribosome for nascent polypeptides to fold, it remains unclear whether PPIase domain is directly involved in assisting protein folding. Here, we introduced structural change into different regions of TF, and investigated their influence on the chaperone function of TF in assisting the folding of various substrate proteins, including oligomeric glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and monomeric carbonic anhydrase II (CA II) and lysozyme. Results showed that structural disturbances by site-specific mutations in the PPIase active site or by deletion of the PPIase domain from TF affected the chaperone activity of TF toward CA II and GAPDH but had no effect on TF-assisted lysozyme refolding, suggesting PPIase domain is involved in assisting the folding of substrates larger than lysozyme. Mutants with the structural disturbances in the crevice totally lost the chaperone activity toward all the substrates we used in this investigation. These results provide further evidence to confirm that the crevice is the major chaperone site of TF, and the hydrophobic pocket in PPIase domain acts as an auxiliary site to assist the folding of substrate proteins bound to the crevice in a substrate-dependent manner, which is beneficial for TF to provide appropriate assistance for protein folding by changing protective space and binding affinity.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20096367 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Liu CP, Zhou QM, Fan DJ, Zhou JM</author>\n    <category>Int J Biochem Cell Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20096367</guid>\n</item>	83	1266485067

Understanding how these proteins adopt their native, biologically active structures in the complex milieu of a membrane is therefore a major challenge in today's life sciences.

Dimerization of CRLR with RAMP1 provides specificity for CGRP versus related agonists.

The extracellular protein domains corresponding to residues 23 to 133 of CRLR and residues 26 to 117 of RAMP1 were shown to be sufficient for formation of a stable, monodisperse complex. The binding affinity of the purified ECD complex for CGRP peptide was significantly less than that of the native receptor, (IC50 = 12 microM for purified ECD complex versus 233 pM for membrane-bound CGRP receptor), indicating that other regions of CRLR and/or RAMP1 are important for peptide agonist binding.

The rATcpnalpha homo-oligomer was shown to possess 8-fold symmetry while both rATcpnbeta and rATcpnalphabeta oligomers adopted 9-fold symmetry. rATcpnalphabeta oligomers were shown to contain the alpha and beta subunits in a 1:2 ratio. All of the complexes prevented the irreversible inactivation of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase at 55 degrees C and completely prevented the formation of aggregates during thermal inactivation of citrate synthase at 45 degrees C. All rATcpn complexes showed trace ATP hydrolysis activity. Furthermore, rATcpnbeta sequestered fully chemically denatured substrates (GFP and thermophilic malic dehydrogenase) in vitro without refolding them in an ATP-dependent manner. This property is similar to previously reported properties of chaperonins from Sulfolobus tokodaii and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius.

In this work, we describe the equilibrium unfolding of Archaeoglobus fulgidus CopA, an 804 residues alpha-helical membrane protein involved in transporting Cu(+) throughout biological membranes. The incubation of CopA reconstituted in phospholipid/detergent mixed micelles with high concentrations of guanidinium hydrochloride induced a reversible decrease in fluorescence quantum yield, far UV ellipticity, and the loss of ATPase and phosphatase activities. Refolding of CopA from this unfolded state led to recovery of full biological activity and all the structural features of the native enzyme. CopA unfolding showed typical characteristics of a two state process with DeltaG(w) degrees = 12.9 kJ.mol(-1), m= 4.1 kJ.mol(-1).M(-1), C(m) = 3 M and DeltaCp(w) degrees = 0.93 kJ.mol(-1).K(-1). These results point out to a fine-tuning mechanism for improving protein stability. Circular dichroism spectroscopic analysis of the unfolded state shows that most of the secondary and tertiary structure was disrupted. The fraction of Trp fluorescence accessible to soluble quenchers shifted from 0.52 in the native state to 0.96 in the unfolded state with a significant spectral red shift. Also, hydrophobic patches in CopA, mainly located in the transmembrane region, were disrupted as indicated by 1-anilino-naphtalene-8-sulfonate fluorescence. Nevertheless, the unfolded state had a small but detectable amount of residual structure, which might play a key role in both CopA folding and adaptation for working at high temperatures.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20114054 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Roman EA, ArgÃ¼ello JM, GonzÃ¡lez Flecha FL</author>\n    <category>J Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20114054</guid>\n</item>	70	1266917662

Here, a 1.9 A resolution crystal structure of the isolated kinase domain from the alpha2 subunit of human AMPK, the first from a multicellular organism, is presented. This human form adopts a catalytically inactive state with distorted ATP-binding and substrate-binding sites. The ATP site is affected by changes in the base of the activation loop, which has moved into an inhibited DFG-out conformation. The substrate-binding site is disturbed by changes within the AMPKalpha2 catalytic loop that further distort the enzyme from a catalytically active form. Similar structural rearrangements have been observed in a yeast AMPK homologue in response to the binding of its auto-inhibitory domain; restructuring of the kinase catalytic loop is therefore a conserved feature of the AMPK protein family and is likely to represent an inhibitory mechanism that is utilized during function.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20124709 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Littler DR, Walker JR, Davis T, Wybenga-Groot LE, Finerty PJ, Newman E, Mackenzie F, Dhe-Paganon S</author>\n    <category>Acta Crystallogr Sect F Struct Biol Cryst Commun</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20124709</guid>\n</item>	28	1267006326

The role that the MMPs play in normal and pathological conditions has long been of interest. The mechanisms by which the MMPs cleave the different components of the ECM have been examined extensively. Some of these studies have been made possible, in part, by the ability to express recombinant MMPs. These recombinant MMPs have been utilized in both structural and functional studies. In addition, future studies can benefit from the availability of recombinant MMPs. Recombinant MMPs have been expressed in mammalian and bacterial recombinant expression systems. The most common bacterial expression system employed for this has been the utilization of expression plasmids in Escherichia coli. This has resulted in the production of a large amount of protein in a short period of time. The expression of a recombinant truncated form of human stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) will be used to illustrate the methods utilized for the expression of a MMP in E. coli. This will include discussions about the expression vector, the cloning of the MMP cDNA into the expression vector, protein induction, protein extraction, protein refolding and purification, and protein characterization.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20135276 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Windsor LJ, Steele DL</author>\n    <category>Methods Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20135276</guid>\n</item>	12	1267602182

Because Smad proteins transduce TGF-beta signaling from the cytosol to the nucleus and HSP72 assists in protein folding and facilitates nuclear translocation, we investigated whether HSP72 inhibits TGF-beta-induced EMT by modulating Smad expression, activation, and nuclear translocation. To evaluate the roles of distinct HSP72 structural domains in these processes, we constructed vectors that expressed wild-type HSP72 or mutants lacking either the peptide-binding domain (HSP72-DeltaPBD), which is responsible for substrate binding and refolding, or the nuclear localization signal (HSP72-DeltaNLS). Overexpression of wild-type HSP72 or HSP72-DeltaNLS inhibited TGF-beta1-induced EMT, but HSP72-DeltaPBD did not, suggesting a critical role for the PBD in this inhibition. HSP72 overexpression inhibited TGF-beta1-induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad3 and p-Smad3, but not Smad2; these inhibitory effects required the PBD but not the NLS. Coimmunoprecipitation assays suggested a physical interaction between Smad3 and the PBD. siRNA knockdown of endogenous HSP72 enhanced both TGF-beta1-induced Smad3 phosphorylation and EMT and confirmed the interaction of HSP72 with both Smad3 and p-Smad3. In vivo, induction of HSP72 by geranylgeranylacetone suppressed Smad3 phosphorylation in renal tubular cells after unilateral ureteral obstruction. In conclusion, HSP72 inhibits EMT in renal epithelial cells primarily by exerting domain-specific effects on Smad3 activation and nuclear translocation.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20133478 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Zhou Y, Mao H, Li S, Cao S, Li Z, Zhuang S, Fan J, Dong X, Borkan SC, Wang Y, Yu X</author>\n    <category>J Am Soc Nephrol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20133478</guid>\n</item>	2	1267868441

During heat shock, both constitutive and stress-inducible HSPs bind to and inhibit irreversible aggregation of denatured protein and facilitate their refolding once normal cellular conditions are re-established. Recent interest in HSPs has been propelled by their association with various human diseases. Amphibian model systems, as shown in this review, have had a significant impact on our understanding of hsp gene expression and function. Some amphibian hsp genes are expressed constitutively during oogenesis and embryogenesis, while others are developmentally regulated and enriched in selected tissues in a stress-inducible fashion. For example, while hsp70 genes are heat-inducible after the midblastula stage, hsp30 genes are not inducible until late neurula/early tailbud. This particular phenomenon is likely controlled by chromatin structure. Also, hsp genes are expressed during regeneration, primarily in response to wounding-associated trauma. The availability of amphibian cultured cells has enabled the analysis of hsp gene expression induced by different stresses (e.g. cadmium, arsenite, proteasome inhibitors etc.), HSP intracellular localization, and their involvement in stress resistance. Furthermore, hyperthermia treatment of adult amphibians reveal that certain tissues were more sensitive than others in terms of hsp gene expression. Finally, this review details the evidence available for the role of amphibian small HSPs as molecular chaperones.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20138231 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Heikkila JJ</author>\n    <category>Comp Biochem Physiol A Mol Integr Physiol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20138231</guid>\n</item>	11	1268191380

Equilibrium unfolding process of MSG exhibited three-state transition thus, indicating the presence of atleast a stable equilibrium intermediate. Thermodynamic parameters suggest this intermediate resembles the unfolded state. However, the equilibrium intermediate exhibits pronounced secondary structure as measured by far-UV CD, partial tertiary structure as delineated by near-UV CD, compactness (m value) and exposed hydrophobic surface area as assessed by ANS binding- typically depicting a molten globule state. The stopped-flow kinetic data provide clear evidence for the presence of a burst phase during the refolding pathway due to the formation of an early Intermediate, within the dead time of the instrument. Refolding from 4M to various lower concentrations until 0.4M of GdnHCl follow biphasic kinetics at lower concentrations of GdnHCl (&lt; 0.8M), whereas monophasic kinetics at concentrations above 1.5M.

Our results indicated that protein disulfide isomerase-P5 (PDI-P5) human homolog was down-regulated from the epididymal corpus to cauda sperm, in contrast to the constant expression of protein disulfide isomerase A3 (PDIA3) human homolog. To examine the functions of PDIA3 and PDI-P5, we cloned and sequenced cDNAs of pig PDIA3 and PDI-P5 protein precursors. Each recombinant pig mature PDIA3 and PDI-P5 expressed in Escherichia coli showed thiol-dependent disulfide reductase activities in insulin turbidity assay. Although PDIA3 showed chaperone activity to promote oxidative refolding of reduced denatured lysozyme, PDI-P5 exhibited anti-chaperone activity to inhibit oxidative refolding of lysozyme at an equimolar ratio. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis suggested that disulfide cross-linked and non-productively folded lysozyme was responsible for the anti-chaperone activity of PDI-P5.

In this work, we have expressed human laforin in E. coli in the form of inclusion bodies devoid of any fusion tags. After a rapid dilution refolding step, the protein was purified by two chromatographic steps, yielding 5 - 7 mg of purified protein per liter of bacterial culture.

Collagen-like proteins have been found recently in a number of bacteria, but little is known about their folding mechanism. The Scl2 collagen-like protein from Streptococcus pyogenes has an N-terminal globular domain, designated V(sp), adjacent to its triple-helix domain. The V(sp) domain is required for proper refolding of the Scl2 protein in vitro. Here recombinant V(sp) domain alone is shown to form trimers with a significant alpha-helix content and to have a thermal stability of T(m) = 45 degrees C. Examination of a new construct shows that the V(sp) domain facilitates efficient in vitro refolding only when it is located N-terminal to the triple-helix domain but not when C-terminal to the triple-helix domain. Fusion of the V(sp) domain N-terminal to a heterologous (Gly-Xaa-Yaa)(n) sequence from Clostridium perfringens led to correct folding and refolding of this triple-helix, which was unable to fold into a triple-helical, soluble protein on its own. These results suggest that placement of a functional trimerization module adjacent to a heterologous Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeating sequence can lead to proper folding in some cases, but also shows specificity in the relative location of the trimerization and triple-helix domains. This information about their modular nature can be used in the production of novel types of bacterial collagen for biomaterial applications.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20162611 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Yu Z, Mirochnitchenko O, Xu C, Yoshizumi A, Brodsky B, Inouye M</author>\n    <category>Protein Sci</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20162611</guid>\n</item>	0	1268191379

To investigate the role of nonlocal interactions in tertiary structure formation, we performed a nonlocal interaction substitution mutation analysis on staphylococcal nuclease (SNase). Y54 and I139 of wild-type (WT) SNase and Delta140-149 were substituted by cysteine to form intramolecular disulfide bonds, respectively called WT-SS and Delta140-149-SS. Under physiological conditions, the reduced form of Delta140-149-SS appears to assume a denatured structure; in contrast, the oxidized form of Delta140-149-SS forms a native-like structure. From this result, we conclude that the C-terminal region participates in a nonlocal interaction that is indispensable for the native structure. Although the oxidized form of WT-SS assumes a more compact denatured structure under acidic conditions than the WT, the kinetic measurements reveal that the refolding reactions of both the reduced and oxidized forms of WT-SS are similar to those of the WT, suggesting that an intact nonlocal interaction is established within the dead time (22 ms). On the basis of these results, we propose that the native nonlocal contact established at the early stage of the folding process facilitates further secondary structure formation.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20159164 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Kato S, Kamikubo H, Hirano S, Yamazaki Y, Kataoka M</author>\n    <category>Biophys J</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20159164</guid>\n</item>	1	1268191379

It has been suggested to act as a molecular chaperone, while a mutant form associated with early-onset torsion dystonia, a dominantly inherited movement disorder, appears to result in a net loss of function in vivo. Thus far, no studies have examined the chaperone activity of torsinA in vitro. Here we expressed and purified both wild-type (WT) and mutant torsinA fusion proteins in bacteria and examined their ability to function as molecular chaperones by monitoring suppression of luciferase and citrate synthase (CS) aggregation. We also assessed their ability to hold proteins in an intermediate state for refolding. As measured by light scattering and SDS-PAGE, both WT and mutant torsinA effectively, and similarly, suppressed protein aggregation compared to controls. This function was not further enhanced by the presence of ATP. Further, we found that while neither form of torsinA could protect CS from heat-induced inactivation, they were both able to reactivate luciferase when ATP and rabbit reticulocyte lysate were added. This suggests that torsinA holds luciferase in an intermediate state, which can then be refolded in the presence of other chaperones. These data provide conclusive evidence that torsinA acts as a molecular chaperone in vitro and suggests that early-onset torsion dystonia is likely not a consequence of a loss in torsinA chaperone activity but might be an outcome of insufficient torsinA localization at the ER to manage protein folding or trafficking.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20169475 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Burdette AJ, Churchill PF, Caldwell GA, Caldwell KA</author>\n    <category>Cell Stress Chaperones</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20169475</guid>\n</item>	4	1268455281

Mammalian sHsps (HSPBs) are multifunctional proteins involved in many cellular processes including those which are not directly related to protein folding and aggregation. HSPBs participate in cell development and cancerogenesis, regulate apoptosis and control cytoskeletal architecture. Recent data revealed that HSPBs also play an important role in membrane stabilization. Mutation in HSPB genes have been identified, which are responsible for the development of cataract, desmin related myopathy and neuropathies. HSPBs are often found as components of protein aggregates associated with protein-misfolding disorders, such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Alexander's and prion diseases. It is supposed that the presence of HSPBs in intra- or extracellular protein deposits is a consequence of the chaperone activity of HSPBs, however more studies are needed to reveal the exact function of HSPBs during the formation (or removal) of disease-related aggregates.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20166966 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Laskowska E, Matuszewska E, KuczyÅ„ska-WiÅ›nik D</author>\n    <category>Curr Pharm Biotechnol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20166966</guid>\n</item>	1	1268455281

The polyQ diseases are a group of nine hereditary neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington's disease (HD) and various types of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), which are caused by abnormal expansions of the polyQ stretch (&gt; 35-40 repeats) in unrelated disease-causative proteins. The expanded polyQ stretch is thought to trigger misfolding of these proteins, leading to their aggregation and accumulation as inclusion bodies in affected neurons, eventually resulting in neurodegeneration. Misfolding and aggregation of the polyQ protein are the most ideal therapeutic targets since they are the most upstream events in the pathogenic cascade, and therefore, therapeutic approaches using molecular chaperones, which prevent protein misfolding and assist the refolding of misfolded proteins, are being extensively investigated. Indeed, a variety of molecular chaperones such as Hsp70 and Hsp40 have been demonstrated to exert therapeutic effects against various experimental models of the polyQ diseases. Furthermore, toward developing pharmacological therapies, small chemical activators of heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) such as geldanamycin and its derivative 17-AAG, which induce multiple endogenous molecular chaperones, have been proven to be effective not only in polyQ disease models, but also in other neurodegenerative disease models.

Besides rhodopsin, X-ray structures of classical GPCRs have only recently been resolved, including the beta1 and beta2 adrenergic receptors and the A2A adenosine receptor. This lag in obtaining GPCR structures is due to several tedious steps that are required before beginning the first crystallization experiments: protein expression, detergent solubilization, purification and stabilization. With the aim to obtain active membrane receptors for functional and crystallization studies, we first have recently reported a screen of expression conditions for approximately 100 GPCRs in E. coli, providing large amounts of inclusion bodies, a prerequisite for the subsequent refolding step (Michalke et al. 2009 Anal. Biochem. 386,147-155). Here we report a novel artificial chaperone-assisted refolding procedure adapted for the GPCR inclusion body refolding, followed by protein purification and characterization. The refolding of two selected targets, the mouse cannabinoid receptor 1 (muCB1R) and the human parathyroid hormone receptor 1 (huPTH1R), was achieved from solubilized receptors using detergent and cyclodextrin as protein folding assistants. We could demonstrate excellent affinity of both refolded and purified receptors for their respective ligands.

We show that residual structure in fully denatured photoactive yellow protein (PYP) is affected by isomerization of its p-coumaric acid (pCA) chromophore. The exposure of total surface area and hydrophobic surface area upon unfolding were quantified by denaturant m values and heat capacity changes DeltaCp, respectively. The exposure of buried surface area upon the unfolding of the acid denatured state of PYP containing trans-pCA is ~20% smaller than that of the native state. In contrast, for the partially unfolded pB photocycle intermediate containing cis-pCA unfolding-induced exposure of surface area is not decreased. These results show that pCA photoisomerization reduces residual structure in the fully unfolded state. Thus, residual structure in the fully unfolded state of PYP is under direct experimental control by photoexcitation. The sensitivity of the unfolded state to pCA isomerization provides a novel criterion that residual structure in the unfolded state of PYP is native-like, involving native-like protein-chromophore interactions. A largely untested prediction is that native-like residual structure facilitates the conformational search during folding. In the case of PYP refolding from the less disordered fully unfolded state containing trans-pCA indeed is substantially accelerated. The burial of significant hydrophobic surface area in the fully unfolded state suggests that a significant part of the hydrophobic collapse process already has occurred in the denatured state.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20178976 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Lee BC, Kumauchi M, Hoff WD</author>\n    <category>J Biol Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20178976</guid>\n</item>	1	1268544101

We described in vivo (i.e., in Escherichia coli) and in vitro protocols for segmental isotopic labeling of multi-domain and fusion proteins via protein trans-splicing (PTS) using split DnaE intein without any refolding steps or alpha-thioester modification. The advantage of PTS approach is that it can be carried out in vivo by time-delayed dual-expression system with two controllable promoters.

The performance of the designed microfluidic chips was evaluated by the refolding of difficult-to-fold proteins (citrate synthase and the zetaassociated protein 70 kDa protein kinase domain). We demonstrated this by varying the flow rates of the diluting buffer stream(s) and multi-junctions which could control the different flow rate ratios of the buffer stream(s) and the denatured protein stream. By this strategy, we were able to improve the efficiency of protein refolding. Our method achieved refolding within a short period of time at room temperature without the need of any small molecules or chaperone proteins. Moreover, the efficiency of protein refolding by microfluidic chip was found higher than that prepared by dialysis or dilution.

This paper presents an investigation of the refolding of tetrameric beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) using Arg HCl and other salts. In a binary system using only Arg HCl, the refolding yield of beta-gal increased with increasing concentration up to 0.2 M. However, the refolding yield sharply decreased above this concentration, reaching the level below the control yield of 5% at 0.5 M and near zero above 0.75 M, an observation unexpected from monomeric proteins. In a ternary system using both 0.2 M Arg HCl and another salt, the refolding yield increased up to 1.5-fold higher than that in the binary system. These data indicate that aggregation suppressive effects of protein increase with Arg HCl concentration, but also are deleterious to self-association of the protein. This dual nature of Arg HCl effects may have to be taken into account in its application for refolding of oligomeric proteins.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20213119 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Fujimoto A, Hirano A, Shiraki K</author>\n    <category>Protein J</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20213119</guid>\n</item>	2	1269508070

We investigate here the roles of the stoichiometric zinc and copper ions in modulating the oxidative refolding of reduced, denatured bovine erythrocyte SOD1 at physiological pH and room temperature. Fluorescence experiment results showed that the oxidative refolding of the demetalated SOD1 (apo-SOD1) is biphasic, and the addition of stoichiometric Zn(2+) into the refolding buffer remarkably accelerates both the fast phase and the slow phase of the oxidative refolding, compared with without Zn(2+). Aggregation of apo-SOD1 in the presence of stoichiometric Zn(2+) is remarkably slower than that in the absence of Zn(2+). In contrast, the effects of stoichiometric Cu(2+) on both the rates of the oxidative refolding and the aggregation of apo-SOD1 are not remarkable. Experiments of resistance to proteinase K showed that apo-SOD1 forms a conformation with low-level proteinase K resistance during refolding and stoichiometric Cu(2+) has no obvious effect on the resistance to proteinase K. In contrast, when the refolding buffer contains stoichiometric zinc, SOD1 forms a compact conformation with high-level proteinase K resistance during refolding. Our data here demonstrated that stoichiometric zinc plays an important role in the oxidative refolding of low micromolar bovine SOD1 by accelerating the oxidative refolding, suppressing the aggregation during refolding, and helping the protein to form a compact conformation with high protease resistance activity.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20213043 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Li HT, Jiao M, Chen J, Liang Y</author>\n    <category>Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai)</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20213043</guid>\n</item>	9	1269595417

In the latter case, it was always assumed that proteins in inclusion bodies (IBs) are more or less unfolded and hence require complete denaturing condition for solubilization, which uses strong detergents, urea or guanidine hydrochloride. However, we often observe distribution of expressed proteins in both soluble and insoluble fractions. In such expression, IBs are often loose and of flocculate morphology. We believe that such distribution is due to association of near native structures of the expressed proteins, which cause either aggregation into insoluble fractions or unstable soluble proteins. In our experience, although not reported by others, interleukin-1alpha, interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factors, fibroblast growth factors, His-tagged fyn kinase and many other proteins showed such behavior. If this occurs, we have experienced problems of instability, low yield and insolubility whether purification is done from the soluble fraction or by refolding of IBs.

In the present study, we found that the fifth BAG domain (BD5) of BAG5 is responsible for the interaction between Hsp70 and BAG5. We also determined the crystal structures of the BD5*NBD complex. BD5 binding caused two different types of NBD conformational changes, which both disrupted the nucleotide-binding groove. In fact, BD5 reduced the affinity of the NBD for ADP.

This approach is very efficient and can offer many potential applications. In this study, the detailed examination of process reversibility is explored. Two forms of concatenation, horizontal and vertical concatenation of data matrices, are introduced and the latter is discussed in detail. Concatenated 2D correlation analysis allows one to investigate directly the correlation between two independent but related spectral data sets. It can extract more detailed information, such as the comparison of effects of two different perturbations or different systems. We describe the principle of the "mirror-image concatenation" in 2D correlation analysis, which is applied to demonstrate its reliability and efficiency on three spectral models: a synthetic simulation data set; experimental Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the thermally induced unfolding-refolding transition of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase A) in aqueous solution; and a set of FT-IR spectra of traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) of similar origin. The concatenated 2D correlation analysis shows its power in revealing the irreversibility of the thermally induced conformation transition of RNase A as well as the comparison of different species of TCM.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20223072 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Zhang L, Noda I, Wu Y</author>\n    <category>Appl Spectrosc</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20223072</guid>\n</item>	3	1270014611

At various time points (ranging from 10 ms to 5 min) after a pH jump from 2 to 7 the protein is exposed to a microsecond hydroxyl radical (.OH) pulse that induces oxidative labeling of solvent-exposed side chains. Most of the covalent modifications appear as+16 Da adducts that are readily detectable by mass spectrometry (MS). The overall extent of labeling decreases as folding proceeds, reflecting dramatic changes in the accessibility of numerous residues. Peptide mapping and MS/MS reveal that the side chains of C14, C17, H33, F46, Y48, W59, M65, Y67, Y74, M80, I81, and Y97 are among the dominant sites of oxidation. Temporal changes in the accessibility of these residues are consistent with docking of the N-and C-terminal helices as early as 10 ms. However, structural reorganization at the helix interface takes place up to at least 1 s. Initial misligation of the heme iron by H33 leads to distal crowding, giving rise to low solvent accessibility of the displaced (native) M80 ligand and the adjacent I81. W59 retains a surprisingly high accessibility long into the folding process, indicating the presence of packing defects in the hydrophobically collapsed core. Overall, the results of this work are consistent with previous hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) studies that proposed a foldon-mediated mechanism. The structural data obtained by .OH labeling monitor the packing and burial of side chains, whereas HDX primarily monitors the formation of secondary structure elements. Hence, the two approaches yield complementary information. Considering the very short time scale of pulsed oxidative labeling, a future extension of the approach used here to sub-millisecond folding studies should be feasible.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20230834 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Stocks BB, Konermann L</author>\n    <category>J Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20230834</guid>\n</item>	5	1270611299

SA-mIL15 fusion protein was purified through the Ni-NTA affinity chromatography, and mIL15-SA fusion protein through anion exchange chromatography, followed by refolding. The efficiency of surface modification of the fusion proteins on the biotinylated RM-1 tumor cells was evaluated by a flow cytometer.

EL is closely related to alpha-lactalbumins with respect to sequence and structure and further possesses the calcium binding site of alpha-lactalbumins. Recently, EL multimeric complexes with oleic acids (ELOA) were shown to possess tinctorial and morphological properties, similar to amyloidal aggregates, and to be cytotoxic. ELOA's interactions with phospholipid membranes appears to be central to its biological action, similar to human alpha-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells (HAMLET). Here, we describe the interaction of ELOA with phospholipid membranes. Confocal scanning laser microscopy shows that ELOA, but not native EL, accumulates on the surface of giant unilamellar vesicles, without inducing significant membrane permeability. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) data indicated an essentially non-disruptive binding of ELOA to supported lipid bilayers, leading to formation of highly dissipative and "soft" lipid membrane; at higher concentrations of ELOA, the lipid membrane desorbs from the surface probably as bilayer sheets of vesicles. This membrane rearrangement occurred to a similar extent when free oleic acid (OA) was added, but not when free OA was removed from ELOA by prior incubation with BSA, emphasizing the role of OA in this process. NMR data indicated an equilibrium between free and bound OA which shifts towards free OA as ELOA is progressively diluted indicating that OA is relatively loosely bound. Activity measurements together with fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism suggested a conversion of ELOA toward a more native-like state on interaction with lipid membranes, although complete refolding was not observed. Altogether, these results suggest that ELOA may act as an OA carrier and facilitate OA transfer to the membrane. ELOA's properties illustrate that protein folding variants may possess specific functional properties distinct from the native protein.

Further lowering of the pH reversed these effects, suggesting that apo-Ngb folds back to a compact state. At pH 2.0, the apo-Ngb forms a folding intermediate known as molten globule (MG), which is possessed of native-like secondary structure and almost complete loss of tertiary structure.

A high cell density (HCD) fed-batch fermentation process was used to produce rhVEGF in periplasmic inclusion bodies.

This mutation results from the substitution of asparagine (AAC) by lysine (AAA) at codon 103 of a non-mature (signal peptide-containing) leptin and corresponds to the N82K mutation in the mature protein. The patient had very low serum leptin levels, raising the question of whether the obese phenotype resulted from low leptin levels or from its lower intrinsic activity. To answer this question, we characterized the functional consequences of the N82K mutation. Wild-type (WT) human leptin was mutated accordingly, expressed in Escherichia coli at high yield, purified to homogeneity as a monomer and compared to WT human leptin prepared by the same methodology. Circular dichroism analysis of the mutated leptin indicated proper refolding and a secondary structure identical to that of the WT human leptin. In contrast to WT human leptin, the N82K mutant did not form a detectable complex with human leptin-binding domain (hLBD) and its binding capacity to hLBD assessed in a nonradioactive receptor-binding assay was at least 500-fold lower than that of WT human leptin. The biological activity of the N82K mutant, tested in two cell bioassays, was reduced by more than three orders of magnitude relative to WT human leptin. Therefore, though the present report does not explain the reason for the low circulating leptin levels it definitely documents that the reported obese phenotype originates not only from low serum leptin levels but also from the N82K mutant's almost total lack of intrinsic leptin activity.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20307995 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Niv-Spector L, Shpilman M, Grupi A, Gertler A</author>\n    <category>Mol Genet Metab</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20307995</guid>\n</item>	52	1271126705

METHODS: PDGFRL mRNA and protein levels were measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry in CRC and colorectal normal tissues. PDGFRL prokaryotic expression vector was carried out in Escherichia coli (E. coli), and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The effect of PDGFRL protein on CRC HCT-116 cells was detected by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), clone counting, cell cycle, and wound healing assay. RESULTS: Both RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry showed that the expression of PDGFRL in colorectal normal tissues was higher than in cancer tissues. Recombinant pET22b-PDGFRL prokaryotic expression vector was successfully expressed in E. coli, and the target protein was expressed in the form of inclusion bodies. After purification and refolding, recombinant human PDGFRL (rhPDGFRL) could efficiently inhibit the proliferation and invasion of CRC HCT-116 cells detected by MTT, clone counting and wound healing assay. Moreover, rhPDGFRL arrested HCT-116 cell cycling at the G0/G1 phase. CONCLUSION: PDGFRL is a potential gene for application in the anti-cancer therapy for CRC.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20333786 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Guo FJ, Zhang WJ, Li YL, Liu Y, Li YH, Huang J, Wang JJ, Xie PL, Li GC</author>\n    <category>World J Gastroenterol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20333786</guid>\n</item>	103	1271126705

PTB1ratio4W has a probe-dependent thermal unfolding curve and sub-millisecond T-jump relaxation kinetics on more than one time scale. Its refolding rate in denaturant is a non-linear function of denaturant concentration (curved chevron plot). Yet at high denaturant concentration its unfolding is probe-independent, and the folding kinetics can be fitted to a single exponential decay. The domain appears to fold via a mechanism between downhill folding and activated folding over several small barriers, and when denaturant is added, one of these barriers greatly increases and simplifies the observed folding to apparent two-state kinetics. We predict the simplest free energy function consistent with the thermal denaturation and kinetics experiments by using the singular value Smoluchowski dynamics (SVSD) model. PTB1ratio4W is a natural 'missing link' between downhill and activated folding. We suggest mutations that could move the protein into the downhill folding limit.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20336253 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Liu F, Maynard C, Scott G, Melnykov A, Hall KB, Gruebele M</author>\n    <category>Phys Chem Chem Phys</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20336253</guid>\n</item>	10	1271213926

E is an elongated transmembrane protein with three domains, and is organized as a homodimer on the mature virus particle. During fusion the E protein homodimer dissociates, inserts the hydrophobic fusion loop into target membranes, and refolds to a trimeric hairpin in which domain III (DIII) packs against the central trimer. It is clear that E refolding drives membrane fusion but the steps in hairpin formation and their pH requirements are unclear. Here we have used truncated forms of the DV E protein to reconstitute trimerization in vitro. Protein constructs containing domains I and II (DI/II) were monomeric and interacted with membranes to form core trimers. DI/II membrane interaction and trimerization occurred efficiently at both neutral and low pH. The DI/II core trimer was relatively unstable, and could be stabilized by binding exogenous DIII, or by the formation of mixed trimers containing DI/II plus E protein with all three domains. The mixed trimer had unoccupied DIII interaction sites that could specifically bind exogenous DIII at either low or neutral pH. Truncated DV E proteins thus reconstitute hairpin formation and define properties of key domain interactions during DV fusion.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20335260 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Liao M, SÃ¡nchez-San MartÃ­n C, Zheng A, Kielian M</author>\n    <category>J Virol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20335260</guid>\n</item>	86	1271213926

The native state, the transition state, and the unfolded protein are treated as effective hard spheres, with the folded and transition state radii independent of the size and concentration of the crowders. Remarkably, we find that, as the effective unfolded state radius is very weakly dependent on the crowder concentration, it can also be approximated by a single size. The same model predicts the effect of crowding on the folding barrier and therefore refolding rates with no adjustable parameters. A simple extension of the scaled-particle theory model, assuming additivity, can also describe the behavior of mixtures of crowding particles.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20338853 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Mittal J, Best RB</author>\n    <category>Biophys J</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20338853</guid>\n</item>	1	1271476585

A disulfide bond is located in the folding initiation site of onconase (the C-terminal part of the protein molecule) that is missing in ribonuclease A, whereas the other three disulfide bonds of onconase are conserved in ribonuclease A. Consequently, the deletion of this C-terminal disulfide bond (C87-C104) allows the impact of the contacts in this region on the folding of onconase to be studied. We found the C87A/C104A-onconase variant to be less active and less stable than the wild-type protein, whereas the tertiary structure, which was determined by both X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, was only marginally affected. The folding kinetics of the variant, however, were found to be changed considerably in comparison to wild-type onconase. Proton exchange experiments in combination with two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy revealed differences in the native-state dynamics of the two proteins in the folding initiation site, which are held responsible for the changed folding mechanism. Likewise, the molecular dynamics simulation of the unfolding reaction indicated disparities for both proteins. Our results show that the high stability of onconase is based on the efficient stabilization of the folding initiation site by the C-terminal disulfide bond. The formation of the on-pathway intermediate, which is detectable during the folding of the wild-type protein and promotes the fast and efficient refolding reaction, requires the presence of this covalent bond.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20349493 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Schulenburg C, Weininger U, Neumann P, Meiselbach H, Stubbs MT, Sticht H, Balbach J, Ulbrich-Hofmann R, Arnold U</author>\n    <category>Chembiochem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20349493</guid>\n</item>	4	1271476585

In this article, we described the cloning, expression, refolding, tissue distribution, and functional analysis of this novel protein. Using polyclonal antibodies generated by immunizing chickens with the recombinant SUSD4, we found that SUSD4 is detectable in murine brains, eyes, spinal cords, and testis but not other tissues. In brains, SUSD4 is highly expressed in the white matter on oligodendrocytes/axons, and in eyes, it is exclusively expressed on the photoreceptor outer segments. In in vitro complement assays, SUSD4 augments the alternative but not the classical pathway of complement activation at the C3 convertase step. In in vivo studies, knocking down SUSD4 expression in zebrafish markedly increases ratios of mortality and developmental abnormality. These results provide the first insight into the important physiological roles of SUSD4 and could help to better understand the pathogenesis of autism and Fryns syndrome.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20348246 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Tu Z, Cohen M, Bu H, Lin F</author>\n    <category>Am J Pathol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20348246</guid>\n</item>	13	1271745874

The insertion of a cysteine residue at the C-terminus of scFv to serve as the conjugation site for PEG led to the formation of highly multimeric scFv during the refolding process; however, PEGylation after refolding drastically dispersed the multimer into monomeric active scFv fragments. Further, the PEGylation of partially refolded scFv during the refolding process improved the PEGylation efficiency and suppressed the formation of highly multimeric scFv; consequently, monomeric active scFv fragments were obtained directly from the insoluble aggregates in E. coli.

Despite their medical importance, very few salivary proteins have been characterized and functionally annotated. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we report on the functional characterisation of a 5'nucleotidase-related (5'Nuc) saliva protein of the tsetse fly Glossina morsitans morsitans. This protein is encoded by a 1668 bp cDNA corresponding at the genomic level with a single-copy 4 kb gene that is exclusively transcribed in the tsetse salivary gland tissue. The encoded 5'Nuc protein is a soluble 65 kDa glycosylated compound of tsetse saliva with a dual anti-hemostatic action that relies on its combined apyrase activity and fibrinogen receptor (GPIIb/IIIa) antagonistic properties. Experimental evidence is based on the biochemical and functional characterization of recombinant protein and on the successful silencing of the 5'nuc translation in the salivary gland by RNA interference (RNAi). Refolding of a 5'Nuc/SUMO-fusion protein yielded an active apyrase enzyme with K(m) and V(max) values of 43+/-4 microM and 684+/-49 nmol Pi/minxmg for ATPase and 49+/-11 microM and 177+/-37 nmol Pi/minxmg for the ADPase activity. In addition, recombinant 5'Nuc was found to bind to GPIIb/IIIa with an apparent K(D) of 92+/-25 nM. Consistent with these features, 5'Nuc potently inhibited ADP-induced thrombocyte aggregation and even caused disaggregation of ADP-triggered human platelets. The importance of 5'Nuc for the tsetse fly hematophagy was further illustrated by specific RNAi that reduced the anti-thrombotic activities in saliva by approximately 50% resulting in a disturbed blood feeding process. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data show that this 5'nucleotidase-related apyrase exhibits GPIIb/IIIa antagonistic properties and represents a key thromboregulatory compound of tsetse fly saliva.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20351782 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Caljon G, De Ridder K, De Baetselier P, Coosemans M, Van Den Abbeele J</author>\n    <category>PLoS One</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20351782</guid>\n</item>	52	1272334600

CD-APES-MNPs are fabricated by grafting mono-tosyl-beta-cyclodextrin (Ts-beta-CD) onto 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APES)-modified magnetic nanoparticles (APES-MNPs). Results obtained from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and vibrating sample magnetometery (VSM) show that the synthesized magnetic nanoparticles are superparamagnetic with a mean diameter of 11.5nm. The beta-CD grafting is confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and elemental analysis. The amount of beta-CD grafted on the APES-MNPs is found to be 0.042mmolg(-1) from elemental analysis. Our refolding results show that a maximum of 85% CA refolding yield can be achieved using these beta-CD-conjugated magnetic nanoparticles which is at the same level as that using liquid-phase artificial chaperone-assisted refolding. In addition, the secondary and tertiary structures of the refolded CA are the same as those of native protein under optimal conditions. These results indicate that CD-APES-MNPs are suitable and efficient stripping agents for solid-phase artificial chaperone-assisted refolding due to easier and faster separation of these nanoparticles from the refolded samples and also due to recycling of the stripping agents.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20350725 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Badruddoza AZ, Hidajat K, Uddin MS</author>\n    <category>J Colloid Interface Sci</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20350725</guid>\n</item>	5	1272510677

The subsequent energy transport and unfolding-refolding events are characterized by using a semiempirical QM/MM molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methodology that is developed in the present work. In the case of high-energy excitation with &lt;193 nm light, the tetrapeptide molecule in the (1)npi* surface overcomes two barriers with approximately 10.0 kcal/mol, respectively, and uses energy consumption for breaking the hydrogen bond as well as the N-C bond in the amide unit, ultimately leading to the ground state via a conical intersection of CI (S(NP)/S(0)) by structural changes of an increased N-C distance and a O-C-C angle in the amide unit (a two-dimensional model of the reaction coordinates). Following this point, relaxation to a hot molecule with its original structure in the ground state is the predominant decay channel. A large amount of heat ( approximately 110.0 kcal/mol) is initially accumulated in the region of the targeted point of the photoexcitation, and more than 60% of the heat is rapidly dissipated into the solvent on the femtosecond time scale. The relatively slower propagation of heat along the peptide backbone reaches a phase of equilibration within 3 ps. A 300 nm photon of light initiates the relaxation along the repulsive S(sigmasigma)((1)sigmasigma*) state and this decays to the CI (S(sigmasigma)/S(0)) in concomitance with the separation of the disulfide bond. Once cysteinyl radicals are generated, the polar solvent of methanol molecules rapidly diffuses around the radicals, forming a solvent cage and reducing the possibility of close contact in a physical sense. The fast unfolding-refolding event is triggered by S-S bond fission and powered by dramatic thermal motion of the methanol solvent that benefits from heat dissipation. The beta-turn opening (unfolding) can be achieved in about 120 ps without the inclusion of the time associated with the photochemical steps and eventually relaxes to a 3(10)-helix structural architecture (refolding) within 200 ps.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20349927 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Chen X, Gao L, Fang W, Phillips DL</author>\n    <category>J Phys Chem B</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20349927</guid>\n</item>	6	1272689209

Heat-shock proteins (HSPs) that are involved in refolding and degradation processes could lower the aggregate load of alpha-synuclein and thus be beneficial in alpha-synucleinopathies. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We co-overexpressed human A53T point-mutated alpha-synuclein and human HSP70 in mice, both under the control of Thy1 regulatory sequences. Behavior read-outs showed no beneficial effect of HSP70 expression in mice. In contrast, motor coordination, grip strength and weight were even worse in the alpha-synucleinopathy model in the presence of HSP70 overexpression. Biochemical analyses revealed no differences in alpha-synuclein oligomers/aggregates, truncations and phosphorylation levels and alpha-synuclein localization was unchanged in immunostainings. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Overexpressing HSP70 in a mouse model of alpha-synucleinopathy did not lower the toxic load of alpha-synuclein species and had no beneficial effect on alpha-synuclein-related motor deficits.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20368804 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Shimshek DR, Mueller M, Wiessner C, Schweizer T, van der Putten PH</author>\n    <category>PLoS One</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20368804</guid>\n</item>	7	1272954072

Refolding of an unfolded protein is efficiently mediated by the Hsc70 system with either type 1 DnaJ protein, DjA1 or DjA2, and a nucleotide exchange factor. A surface plasmon resonance technique was applied to investigate substrate recognition by the Hsc70 system, and demonstrated that multiple Hsc70 proteins and a dimer of DjA1 initially bind independently to an unfolded protein. The association rate of the Hsc70 was faster than that of DjA1 under folding-compatible conditions. The Hsc70 binding involved a conformational change, while the DjA1 binding was bivalent and substoichiometric. Consistently, we found that the bound 14C-labeled Hsc70 to the unfolded protein became more resistant to tryptic digestion. The gel-filtration and cross-linking experiments revealed the predominant presence of the DjA1 dimer. Furthermore, the Hsc70 and DjA1 bound to distinct sets of peptide array sequences. All of these findings argue against the generality of the widely proposed hypothesis that the DnaJ-bound substrate is targeted and transferred to Hsp70. Instead, these results suggest the importance of the bivalent binding of DjA1 dimer that limits unfavorable transitions of substrate conformations in protein folding.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20363747 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Terada K, Oike Y</author>\n    <category>J Biol Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20363747</guid>\n</item>	42	1273043561

Such multiple binding options for a monoclonal antibody could emanate from the possible flexibility of the antigen combining site. To address the molecular details of this phenomenon, single chain antibody (scFv) containing the antigen combining variable domain of mAb-2D10 was constructed. The present work describes the cloning, expression, purification and efficient refolding of scFv-2D10 and its His(6) tag fusion variants. The scFv expressed poorly in soluble/active form in the periplasmic compartment and concurrently exhibited higher tendency towards accumulation in inclusion bodies inside the E. coli cytoplasm. The scFv was refolded from the inclusion bodies with approximately 68 % yield using a previously described protocol which employed concomitant removal of the chaotropic and oxidizing reagents along with the additives. However, their differential removal, as described in the present report resulted in approximately 97 % effective yield of the soluble scFv-2D10, an increase of 42 %. The binding kinetics of the refolded scFv for both the mimicking ligands was examined using surface plasmon resonance experiments. The scFv-2D10 exhibited binding affinities similar to those reported for mAb-2D10 (IgG) showing that the modifications introduced in the refolding protocol have facilitated efficient preparation of active 2D10 scFv.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20363331 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Tapryal S, Krishnan L, Batra JK, Kaur KJ, Salunke DM</author>\n    <category>Protein Expr Purif</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20363331</guid>\n</item>	5	1273043561

The 528scFv-TRAIL, expressed as insoluble inclusion bodies in E. coli, was solubilized and then refolded by using a modified stepwise dialysis method. Treatment with 528scFv-TRAIL resulted in the specific binding to the cell surface of EGFR-positive cells with concomitant deployment of the TRAIL moiety to DR-5 receptor in a manner comparable to a commercially available form of recombinant TRAIL (cTRAIL). 528scFv-TRAIL, prepared by either of three refolding processes described herein, showed potent cytotoxic activity against EGFR-positive TFK-1 cell line and was superior to its parental 528scFv; a recombinant variable fragment with single specificity against human EGFR. Narrow variations in the cytotoxic potential of 528scFv-TRAIL were ascribed to manipulation of redox conditions during the refolding process. Together, our findings point to the potential value of 528scFv-TRAIL for treatment of EGFR-expressing cancers.

Here we use atomic force microscopy and molecular-dynamics simulations to investigate the natural 7-ankyrin repeat protein gankyrin. We find that gankyrin unfolds under force via multiple distinct pathways. The reactions do not proceed in a cooperative manner, nor do they always involve fully stepwise unfolding of one repeat at a time. The peeling away of half an ankyrin repeat, or one or more ankyrin repeats, occurs at low forces; however, intermediate species are formed that are resistant to high forces, and the simulations indicate that in some instances they are stabilized by nonnative interactions. The unfolding of individual ankyrin repeats generates a refolding force, a feature that may be more easily detected in these proteins than in globular proteins because the refolding of a repeat involves a short contraction distance and incurs a low entropic cost. We discuss the origins of the differences between the force- and chemical-induced unfolding pathways of ankyrin repeat proteins, as well as the differences between the mechanics of natural occurring ankyrin repeat proteins and those of designed consensus ankyin repeat and globular proteins.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20371329 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Serquera D, Lee W, Settanni G, Marszalek PE, Paci E, Itzhaki LS</author>\n    <category>Biophys J</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20371329</guid>\n</item>	2	1273633080

First we used a folding deficient C-terminal truncated chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT_Cd9) to obtain tunable selective pressure for enhanced DnaK chaperon function in vivo. Second, we screened selected clones in vitro for CAT_Cd9 activity after growth under selective pressure. We then analyzed how these variants performed as compared to WT DnaK towards folding assistance of a second target protein, namely chemically denatured firefly luciferase. Eleven single point DnaK mutants and 1 truncated variant were identified using CAT_Cd9 as the protein target, while 4 of the 12 selected variants also showed improved luciferase refolding in vitro. This shows that improving the DnaK chaperone by using a certain target substrate protein, does not necessarily result in a loss or reduction in its ability to assist other proteins. Of the 12 identified mutations, half were clustered in the nucleotide binding domain, and half in the lid domain (LD) of DnaK. The truncated variant is characterized by a 35-residue C-terminal truncation (Cd35) and exhibited the highest improvement for luciferase refolding. Cd35 showed a 7-fold increase in initial refolding rate for denatured luciferase and resulted in a 5-fold increase in maximal luminescence as compared to WT DnaK. Given that the best in vitro performing mutants contained LD substitutions, and that the LD is not involved in ATP binding or hydrolysis or client protein association, but is involved in allosteric regulation of the chaperone cycle, we propose that improved DnaK variants result in changes to allosteric domain communication, ultimately retuning the ATP-dependent chaperone cycle.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20381501 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Aponte RA, Zimmermann S, Reinstein J</author>\n    <category>J Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20381501</guid>\n</item>	2	1273895777

Integral components of ATP dependent proteases are motor proteins that unfold stably folded proteins that have been targeted for removal. These proteinunfoldases/ polypeptide translocases use ATP to unfold the target proteins and translocate them into a proteolytic component. Despite the central role of these motor proteins in cell homeostasis, a number of important questions regarding the molecular mechanisms of enzyme catalyzed protein unfolding and translocation remain unanswered. Here we demonstrate that E. coli ClpA, in the absence of the proteolytic component, ClpP, processively and directionally steps along the polypeptide backbone with a kinetic step-size of ~14 amino acids per step, independent of [ATP] with a rate of ~ 19 AA s-1 at saturating [ATP]. In contrast to previous studies by others, we have developed single-turnover fluorescence stopped-flow methods that allow us to quantitatively examine the molecular mechanism of the motor component, ClpA, decoupled from the proteolytic component, ClpP. For the first time, we reveal that ClpA, in the absence of ClpP, translocates polypeptides directionally, processively and in discrete steps similar to other motor proteins that translocate vectorially on a linear lattice, such as nucleic acid helicases and Kinesin. We believe that the methods employed here will be generally applicable to the examination of other AAA+protein translocases involved in a variety of important biological functions where the substrate is not covalently modified, for example; membrane fusion, membrane transport, protein disaggregation, and protein refolding.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20380838 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Rajendar B, Lucius AL</author>\n    <category>J Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20380838</guid>\n</item>	0	1273895777

In particular, the highly conserved cis peptide bond between residues 166 and 167 at the active site of these enzymes controls important steps in their refolding reaction. In this work, we analyzed how conformational folding, reactivation, and cis/trans peptide bond isomerizations are interrelated in the folding kinetics of beta-lactamases that differ in the nature of the cis peptide bond, which involves a Pro167 in the BS3 and TEM-1 enzyme, a Leu167 in the NMCA enzyme, and which is missing in the PER-1 enzyme. The analysis of folding by spectroscopic probes and by the regain of enzymatic activity in combination with double mixing procedures indicates that conformational folding can proceed when the 166-167 bond is still in the incorrect trans form. The very slow trans --&gt; cis isomerization of the Glu166-Xaa167 peptide bond, however, controls the final step of folding and is required for the regain of the enzymatic activity. This very slow phase is absent in the refolding of PER-1, in which the Glu166-Ala167 peptide bond is trans. The double-mixing experiments revealed that a second slow kinetic phase is caused by the cis/trans isomerization of prolines that are trans in the folded proteins. The folding of beta-lactamases is best described by a model that involves parallel pathways. It highlights the role of peptide bond cis/trans isomerisation as a kinetic determinant of folding.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20384356 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Vandenameele J, Lejeune A, Di Paolo A, Brans A, Frere JM, Schmid FX, Matagne A</author>\n    <category>Biochemistry</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20384356</guid>\n</item>	28	1273895777

It was found that (1) at the neutral pH Trx-GcGASA had maximum fluorescence emission at 305 nm following excitation at different wavelengths varying from 250 to 280 nm, which was ascribed to the fluorescence emission from tyrosine residues. (2) The reduction of disulphide bonds lead to the changes in the relative fluorescence intensity between tyrosine and tryptophan residues from 0.7 to 1.8. (3) Both Tyr and Trp residues underwent 12%-21% decrease in fluorescence intensity with the addition of 0.5 mmol x L(-1) GSSG or 5 mmol x L(-1) peroxide. The latter was roughly consistent with the antioxidative activity reported in vivo. (4) No matter whether 1 mmol x L(-1) DTT was absent or present, the fusion protein could not be fully unfolded with lambda(max) &lt; 350 nm following the treatment of 6 mol x L(-1) GdnHCl. (5) Fusion protein Trx-GcGASA experienced GdnHCl-induced denaturation process, and the unfolding equilibrium curve could be well fitted by using two-state model, giving the Gibbs free energy change (deltaG) of 3.7 kJ x mol(-1). However, it was not the case for reduced Trx-GcGASA protein. The aforementioned experimental results will not only provide some guides to investigate the effects of fusion partner Trx on the unfolding thermodynamics, kinetics and refolding process of Trx-GcGASA, but also will be useful for further studies on the strucuture of GA-induced cysteine-rich protein with the help of spectroscopic methods.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20384132 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Zhang T, Feng J, Li Y, Chen R, Tang LX, Pang XF, Ren ZL</author>\n    <category>Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20384132</guid>\n</item>	1	1274165461

The stability of this loop is low, and the Asp160-Pro161 bond at its tip shows conformational heterogeneity with 90 % being in the cis and 10 % in the trans form. The refolding kinetics of N2 are complex because the molecules with cis or trans isomers at Pro161 both fold to native-like conformations, albeit with different rates. We employed consensus design to shorten the seven-residue irregular loop around Pro161 to a four-residue type I' turn without a proline. This increased the conformational stability of N2 by almost 10 kJ mol(-1) and abolished the complexity of the folding kinetics. Turn sequences obtained from in-vitro selections for increased stability strongly resembled those derived from the consensus design. Two other type I' turns of N2 could also be stabilized by consensus design. For all three turns, the gain in stability originates from an increase in the rate of refolding. The turns form native-like structures early during refolding and thus stabilize the folding transition state. The crystal structure of the variant with all three stabilized turns confirms that the 157-163 loop was in fact shortened to a type I' turn and that the other turns maintained their type I' conformation after sequence optimization.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20394751 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Jakob RP, Zierer BK, Weininger U, Hofmann SD, Lorenz SH, Balbach J, Dobbek H, Schmid FX</author>\n    <category>J Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20394751</guid>\n</item>	0	1274165461

As a recombinant protein, in aqueous solution, gammaB aggregates and precipitates upon heating, cooling, exposure to ultraviolet light, or refolding from a denatured state. We have studied soluble gammaB crystallin, as well as each of the above aggregated forms, to determine whether gammaB's polypeptide chain is differently organized in each form. For this purpose, we used : (a) Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR) spectroscopy in the horizontal attenuated total reflectance (HATR) mode, to examine changes in secondary structural content, and (b) transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to examine gross morphological differences. The peak of the gammaB FTIR amide I band shifts from approximately 1633 cm(-1) to approximately 1618 cm(-1) in heat-, UV- and refolding-induced gammaB precipitates, indicating that narrow beta sheets with fewer strands and higher strand twist angles are becoming reorganized into wider, more planar sheets containing larger numbers of shorter strands, with smaller twist angles. In contrast, in cold-induced precipitates, a loss of anti-parallel beta sheet content is observed. This difference is partly explained by the differential effects of temperature on different non-covalent interactions stabilizing protein structures. The native beta sheet content of gammaB crystallin ( approximately 50%) is raised in heat- ( approximately 60%) and refolding-induced ( approximately 58%) precipitates, but lowered in cold- ( approximately 41%), and UV-induced ( approximately 44%) precipitates. Cold precipitates also display approximately 26% helical content. All four aggregates have distinctively different morphological characteristics; this appears to be in keeping with their distinctively different secondary structural contents.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20394579 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Fatima U, Sharma S, Guptasarma P</author>\n    <category>Protein Pept Lett</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20394579</guid>\n</item>	100	1274521599

The recombinant SalG has a melting temperature (T(m)) of 36.8 degrees C under thermal denaturation conditions and regains activity after returning to permissive (low) temperature. Furthermore, refolding is dramatically reduced in solutions with high SalG concentrations, coupled with significant protein precipitation. The structural features of SalG closely resemble those of other g-type lysozymes. However, the N-terminal region of SalG is less anchored to the rest of the molecule due to the absence of disulphide bonds, thus, contributing significantly to the low T(m) of SalG.

The discovery of "gastric mucosal barrier" or "the presence of defense system" might be the answers to these questions. The first level of gastric mucosal barrier consists of the factors secreted into the lumen including bicarbonates, mucus, immunoglobulins, other antibacterial substances including lactoferrin, and surface active phospholipids. The second level of defense system is the gastric epithelia, which are remarkably resistant to acids or irritants and forms relatively tight barrier to passive diffusion. In addition, the epithelium is capable of undergoing extremely rapid repair and restitution if its continuity is disrupted. The third level of gastric mucosal barrier is the mucosal microcirculation in concert with sensory afferent nerves within the mucosa and submucosa. Back diffusion of acid or toxin into the mucosa results in neural system-mediated elevations of calcitonin gene related peptide, which contribute to enhancing mucosal blood flows that are very critical for limiting damage and facilitating repair. The fourth level of defense is the mucosal immune system, consisting of mast cells and macrophage, which orchestrate an appropriate inflammatory response to challenge. All the above factors are known to contribute to orchestrated artwork of "gastric mucosal protection". In recent years, heat shock proteins (HSPs) have been implicated to be an additional factor utilized for the gastric defense mechanisms at the intracellular level. Certain HSPs are expressed under non-stressful conditions and play an important role in the maintenance of normal cell integrity, but HSPs are generally considered to improve cellular recovery both by either refolding partially damaged functional proteins or increasing delivery of precursor proteins to important organelles such as mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, through which HSPs might complete efficient mucosal defense mechanisms and achieve ulcer healing, mostly probably protecting key enzymes related to cytoprotection. In this review, role of each heat shock protein, HSP90, HSP70, HSP27, in gastric inflammation and gastric ulcer healing will be described with general roles of HSPs.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20388941 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Choi SR, Lee SA, Kim YJ, Ok CY, Lee HJ, Hahm KB</author>\n    <category>J Physiol Pharmacol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20388941</guid>\n</item>	2	1275359878

The protein consisted of 451 amino acids with a theoretical pI of 8.98 and molecular weight of 50.5 kDa. Subsequently, the SQR mRNA expression in different tissues was assessed by real-time reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction and showed that the highest expression was in midgut, followed by anal sacs and coelomic fluid cells, and then body wall and hindgut. Furthermore, activated SQR was obtained by dilution refolding of recombinant SQR expression in E. coli, and the refolded product showed optimal activity at 37 degrees C and pH 8.5 and K (m) for ubiquinone and sulfide at 15.6 microM and 40.3 microM, respectively.

However, the mechanism of translocation and post translocation folding is not understood. We identified a mutation (hlyA99) at the extreme C-terminus, which is dominant in competition experiments, blocking secretion of the wild type toxin co-expressed in the same cell. This suggests that unlike recessive mutations which affect recognition of the translocation machinery, the hlyA99 mutation interferes with some later step in secretion. Indeed, the mutation reduced haemolytic activity of the toxin and the activity of beta-lactamase when the latter was fused to a C-terminal 23 kDa fragment of HlyA carrying the hlyA99 mutation. A second mutant (hlyAdel6), lacking the 6 C-terminal residues of HlyA also showed reduced haemolytic activity and neither mutant protein regained normal haemolytic activity in in vitro unfolding/refolding experiments. Tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy indicated differences in structure between the secreted forms of wild type HlyA and the HlyA Del6 mutant. These results suggested that the mutations affected the correct folding of both HlyA and the beta-lactamase fusion. Thus, we propose a dual function for the HlyA C-terminus involving an important role in post translocation folding as well as targeting HlyA for secretion.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20430809 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Jumpertz T, Cherveaux C, Racher K, Zouhair M, Blight MA, Holland IB, Schmitt L</author>\n    <category>Microbiology</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20430809</guid>\n</item>	1	1275627851

During this process, DnaK binds its substrates in coordination with a catalytic ATPase cycle. Both the ATPase and protein-folding activities of DnaK are stimulated by its co-chaperones, DnaJ and GrpE. However, it is not yet clear how changes in the stimulated ATPase rate of DnaK impact the folding process. In this study, we performed mutagenesis throughout the nucleotide-binding domain of DnaK to generate a collection of mutants in which the stimulated ATPase rates varied from 0.7 to 13.6 pmol/mg/min-1. We found that this range was largely established by differences in the ability of the mutants to be stimulated by one or both of the co-chaperones. Next, we explored how changes in ATPase rate might impact refolding of denatured luciferase in vitro and found that the two activities were poorly correlated. Unexpectedly, we found several mutants that refold luciferase normally in the absence of significant ATP turnover, presumably by increasing the flexibility of DnaK. Finally, we tested whether DnaK mutants could complement growth of DeltadnaK E. coli cells under heat shock and found that the ability to refold luciferase was more predictive of in vivo activity than ATPase rate. This study provides insights into how flexibility and co-chaperone interactions affect DnaK-mediated ATP turnover and protein folding.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20439464 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Chang L, Thompson AD, Ung P, Carlson HA, Gestwicki JE</author>\n    <category>J Biol Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20439464</guid>\n</item>	29	1276162580

Previous studies of the Newcastle disease virus, human parainfluenza virus 3 and parainfluenza virus 5 F proteins revealed differences in the pre- and post-fusion structures. The NDV Queensland (Q) F structure lacked structural elements observed in the other two structures, which are key to the refolding and fusogenic activity of F. Here we present the NDV Australia-Victoria (AV) F protein post-fusion structure and provide EM evidence for its folding to a pre-fusion form. The NDV AV F structure contains heptad repeat elements missing in the previous NDV Q F structure, forming a post-fusion six-helix bundle (6HB) similar to the post-fusion hPIV3 F structure. Electrostatic and temperature factor analysis of the F structures points to regions of these proteins that may be functionally important in their membrane fusion activity.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20439109 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Swanson K, Wen X, Leser GP, Paterson RG, Lamb RA, Jardetzky TS</author>\n    <category>Virology</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20439109</guid>\n</item>	12	1276162580

Here, we study the association between neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptors and beta-arrestin2, using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) to directly report underlying protein-protein interactions. Experimental approach: Y1 receptors were tagged with a C-terminal fragment, Yc, of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), and beta-arrestin2 fused with the complementary N-terminal fragment, Yn. After Y receptor-beta-arrestin association, YFP fragment refolding to regenerate fluorescence (BiFC) was examined by confocal microscopy in transfected HEK293 cells. Y receptor/beta-arrestin2 BiFC responses were also quantified by automated imaging and granularity analysis. Key results: NPY stimulation promoted association between Y1-Yc and beta-arrestin2-Yn, and the specific development of BiFC in intracellular compartments, eliminated when using non-interacting receptor and arrestin mutants. Responses developed irreversibly and were slower than for downstream Y1 receptor-YFP internalization, a consequence of delayed maturation and stability of complemented YFP. However, beta-arrestin2 BiFC measurements delivered appropriate ligand pharmacology for both Y1 and Y2 receptors, and demonstrated higher affinity of Y1 compared to Y2 receptors for beta-arrestin2. Receptor mutagenesis combined with beta-arrestin2 BiFC revealed that alternative arrangements of Ser/Thr residues in the Y1 receptor C tail could support beta-arrestin2 association, and that Y2 receptor-beta-arrestin2 interaction was enhanced by the intracellular loop mutation H155P. Conclusions and implications: The BiFC approach quantifies Y receptor ligand pharmacology focused on the beta-arrestin2 pathway, and provides insight into mechanisms of beta-arrestin2 recruitment by activated and phosphorylated 7TMRs, at the level of protein-protein interaction.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20438572 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Kilpatrick L, Briddon S, Hill S, Holliday N</author>\n    <category>Br J Pharmacol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20438572</guid>\n</item>	64	1276223382

The present work studied OmpA70, a putative outer membrane protein from Leptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni that combines structural features of Loa22, the first genetically defined virulence factor in Leptospira, and Lp49, a protein that reacts with sera from early and convalescent patients. Recombinant OmpA was produced in E. coli in an insoluble form. Considering the importance of the structural integrity of a protein to confer immune protection, high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) was used to refold OmpA70 aggregated as inclusion bodies. HHP was applied in association with glutathione, guanidine hydrochloride or L-arginine. About 40% of the protein was refolded by applying 200 MPa for 16h in concentrations of L-arginine above 0.4M. Circular dichroism revealed the presence of secondary structure. OmpA70 has immunogenic and antigenic properties as high antibody titers were seen after immunization with this protein, and sera from infected hamsters reacted with soluble OmpA70.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20450943 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Fraga TR, Chura-Chambi RM, Goncales AP, Morais ZM, Vasconcellos SA, Morganti L, Martins EA</author>\n    <category>J Biotechnol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20450943</guid>\n</item>	2	1276311529

To further explore the role of Mn(2+) in pathogenesis, we undertook a number of studies, including an assessment of the disease modifying effects of chelation therapy in a well-characterised mouse model of prion disease. The di-sodium, calcium derivative of the chelator, cyclohexanediaminetetraacetic acid (Na(2)CaCDTA), was administered intraperitoneally to mice inoculated intra-cerebrally with either high or low-dose inocula, with treatment beginning early (shortly after inoculation) or late (at the usual mid-survival point of untreated mice). Analyses by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) demonstrated brain Mn(2+) levels were selectively reduced by up to 50% in treated mice compared to untreated controls, with copper, iron, zinc and cobalt levels unchanged. In mice administered high-dose inocula, none of the treatment groups displayed an increase in survival although western blot analyses of early intensively treated mice showed reduced brain PrP(Sc) levels; mice infected using low-dose inocula however, showed a significant prolongation of survival (p=0.002). Although our findings support a role for Mn(2+) in prion disease, further studies are required to more precisely delineate the extent of pathogenic involvement.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20456001 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Brazier MW, Volitakis I, Kavasnika M, White AR, Underwood JR, Green JE, Han S, Hill AF, Masters CL, Collins SJ</author>\n    <category>J Neurochem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20456001</guid>\n</item>	7	1276311529

Env interactions with cellular receptors trigger refolding of gp41, which induces close apposition of viral and cellular membranes leading to membrane fusion. The energy released during refolding is used to overcome the kinetic barrier and drives the fusion reaction. Here, we report the crystal structure at 2 A resolution of the complete extracellular domain of gp41 lacking the fusion peptide and the cystein-linked loop. Both the fusion peptide proximal region (FPPR) and the membrane proximal external region (MPER) form helical extensions from the gp41 six-helical bundle core structure. The lack of regular coiled-coil interactions within FPPR and MPER splay this end of the structure apart while positioning the fusion peptide towards the outside of the six-helical bundle and exposing conserved hydrophobic MPER residues. Unexpectedly, the section of the MPER, which is juxtaposed to the transmembrane region (TMR), bends in a 90 degrees-angle sideward positioning three aromatic side chains per monomer for membrane insertion. We calculate that this structural motif might facilitate the generation of membrane curvature on the viral membrane. The presence of FPPR and MPER increases the melting temperature of gp41 significantly in comparison to the core structure of gp41. Thus, our data indicate that the ordered assembly of FPPR and MPER beyond the core contributes energy to the membrane fusion reaction. Furthermore, we provide the first structural evidence that part of MPER will be membrane inserted within trimeric gp41. We propose that this framework has important implications for membrane bending on the viral membrane, which is required for fusion and could provide a platform for epitope and lipid bilayer recognition for broadly neutralizing gp41 antibodies.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20463810 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Buzon V, Natrajan G, Schibli D, Campelo F, Kozlov MM, Weissenhorn W</author>\n    <category>PLoS Pathog</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20463810</guid>\n</item>	93	1276311529

OBJECTIVE: We performed molecular, structural, and immunologic characterization of alpha-La. METHODS: Recombinant alpha-lactalbumin (ralpha-La) was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity, and characterized by means of mass spectrometry and circular dichroism, and its allergenic activity was studied by using microarray technology, as well as in a basophil histamine release assay. IgE epitope mapping was performed with synthetic peptides. RESULTS: According to circular dichroism analysis, ralpha-La represented a folded protein with a high thermal stability and refolding capacity. ralpha-La reacted with IgE antibodies from 57.6% of patients with CM allergy (n = 66) and induced the strongest basophil degranulation with sera from patients with CM allergy who had exhibited gastrointestinal symptoms or severe systemic reactions on CM exposure. ralpha-La contained sequential and conformational IgE epitopes. Superposition of IgE-reactive peptides onto the 3-dimensional structure of alpha-La revealed a close vicinity of the N- and C-terminal peptides within a surface-exposed patch. CONCLUSIONS: ralpha-La can be used for the diagnosis of patients with severe allergic reactions to CM and serves as a paradigmatic tool for the development of therapeutic strategies for CM allergy.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20466413 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Hochwallner H, Schulmeister U, Swoboda I, Focke-Tejkl M, Civaj V, Balic N, Nystrand M, HÃƒÂ¤rlin A, Thalhamer J, Scheiblhofer S, Keller W, Pavkov T, Zafred D, Niggemann B, Quirce S, Mari A, Pauli G, Ebner C, Papadopoulos NG, Herz U, van Tol EA, Valenta R, Spitzauer S</author>\n    <category>J Allergy Clin Immunol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20466413</guid>\n</item>	53	1276590239

In case of FHA1 domain of Rad53, no detectable time course was observed except the initial burst on its refolding process at 4 masculineC, suggesting that the FHA1 domain of Rad53 was already refolded to its native state within the dead time of the SF apparatus and the rate of the refolding is too fast to be observed at this temperature. In contrast, there was an observable alpha-helical burst at -15 masculineC and -20 masculineC in the presence of 45 % ethylene glycol (EGOH) by CD-SF. Besides, the radius of gyration (Rg) of the burst phase intermediate at -20 masculineC shows the intermediate is already compact, and the compaction process was accompanied with the decrease of alpha-helical content at the same temperature. In case of Ki67 FHA domain, ellipticity change at 222 nm was observed on its refolding pathway at -28 masculineC in the presence of 45 % EGOH and 2 mM DTT, indicating that Ki67 FHA domain also takes non-native alpha-helix-rich intermediate on its folding pathway. Time-resolved SAXS experiment was done. As the signal/noise ratio is low, we could not observe the time-dependent signal change through the time course. However, the initial Rg value was obtained as 18.2 +/- 0.5 A, which is much smaller than the unfolded Rg value (26.5 +/- 1.2 A), and is slightly larger than the native one (15.9 +/- 1.8 A). These results suggest that Ki67 FHA domain also forms compact non-native alpha-helix-rich intermediate before refolding to its native beta-structure on the refolding pathway. These results are in good agreement with other beta-proteins, such as bovine beta-lactoglobulin (BLG), src SH3 domain proteins. It seems the alpha-helical burst phases appear on the folding pathway of beta-sandwiched proteins.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20466033 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Matsumura Y, Shinjo M, Mahajan A, Tsai MD, Kihara H</author>\n    <category>Biochimie</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20466033</guid>\n</item>	1	1276678704

The catalytic module of CrdS (cm-CrdS) was expressed in good yield from a cDNA encoding cm-CrdS cloned into the pET-32a(+) vector, containing a coding region for thioredoxin, and from the Champion pET SUMO system that possesses a coding region of a small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) partner protein. The two DNA fusions, designated pET-32a_cm-CrdS and SUMO_cm-CrdS were expressed as chimeric proteins. High yields of inclusion bodies were produced in E. coli and these could be refolded to form soluble proteins, using a range of buffers and non-detergent sulfobetaines. A purification protocol was developed, which afforded a one-step on-column refolding and simultaneous purification of the recombinant 6xHis-tagged SUMO_cm-CrdS protein. The latter protein was digested by a specific protease to yield intact cm-CrdS in high yields. The refolded SUMO_cm-CrdS protein did not exhibit curdlan synthase activity, but showed a circular dischroism spectrum, which had an alpha/beta-type-like conformation. Amino acid sequences of tryptic fragments of the SUMO_cm-CrdS fusion and free cm-CrdS proteins, determined by MALDI/TOF confirmed that the full-length proteins were synthesized by E. coli, and that no alterations in amino acid sequences occurred. A three-dimensional model of cm-CrdS predicted the juxtaposition of highly conserved aspartates D156, D208, D210 and D304, and the QRTRW motif, which are likely to play roles in donor and acceptor substrate binding and catalysis.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20473714 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Hrmova M, Stone BA, Fincher GB</author>\n    <category>Glycoconj J</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20473714</guid>\n</item>	23	1276678703

Although in HepB3 cell culture assays the analogues did exhibit antiproliferative IC(50) values ranging from sub-micromolar to greater than 100muM, inhibition of Cdc25 through cysteine alkylation could not be demonstrated. It was also found that analysis using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) following treatment with the most potent analogue (1t) did not provide data consistent with inhibition at one specific point in the cell cycle, as would be expected if Cdc25A were inhibited. Further studies with a subset of analogues resulted in a correlation of antiproliferative potencies with activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR is a regulatory pathway that temporarily suspends protein production when misfolding of proteins occurs within the endoplastic reticulum (ER). In addition, ER chaperones that promote proper refolding become up-regulated. If cellular damage cannot be resolved by these mechanisms, then the UPR can initiate apoptosis. The current study indicates that these maleimide analogues lead to UPR activation, which is predictive of the selective antiproliferative activity of the series.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20472436 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Muus U, Hose C, Yao W, Kosakowska-Cholody T, Farnsworth D, Dyba M, Lountos GT, Waugh DS, Monks A, Burke TR, Michejda CJ</author>\n    <category>Bioorg Med Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20472436</guid>\n</item>	4	1276678703

Previously, such reagents have been produced either by chemical conjugation or recombinant expression in bacteria. These protocols required laborious processes for purification and refolding. The aim of the work reported in this article was to explore the production of the agglutination assay reagent as both a single chain Fv (scFv) antibody fragment and recombinant full-length mAb, expressed in a secreted form in commonly used mammalian cell lines. The DNA encoding the anti-erythrocyte antibodies was linked to that of a diagnostic peptide from West Nile virus, which requires glycosylation for recognition by antibodies present in the sera of infected horses. The expression vectors were designed to allow the rapid directional insertion of DNA encoding other immunogenic peptides to mediate the secretion of agglutinating scFv and full-length mAb reagents from transfected mammalian cells. Stable cell lines were produced for the expression of most, but not all of the constructs. The recombinant reagents could be used directly from the cell culture media after a simple concentration step. The results indicate that further modifications to increase the yield of recombinant protein will enable the direct use of culture supernatant in diagnostic assays without further processing.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20488206 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Hobson-Peters J, Shan J, Hall RA, Toye P</author>\n    <category>J Virol Methods</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20488206</guid>\n</item>	5	1276767326

Such kinetic effects, especially in time-variable and externally triggered systems, are usually investigated by means of extensive and expensive simulations of large sets of individual folding trajectories. Here we describe the theoretical foundations of a generic approach that not only allows the direct computation of approximate population densities but also reduces the efforts required to analyze the folding energy landscapes to a one-time preprocessing step. The basic idea is to consider the kinetics on individual landscapes and to model external triggers and environmental changes as small but discrete changes in the landscapes. A "barmap" links macrostates of temporally adjacent landscapes and defines the transfer of population densities from one "snapshot" to the next. Implemented in the BarMap software, this approach makes it feasible to study folding processes at the level of basins, saddle points, and barriers for many nonstationary scenarios, including temperature changes, cotranscriptional folding, refolding in consequence to degradation, and mechanically constrained kinetics, as in the case of the translocation of a polymer through a pore.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20504954 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Hofacker IL, Flamm C, Heine C, Wolfinger MT, Scheuermann G, Stadler PF</author>\n    <category>RNA</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20504954</guid>\n</item>	28	1276767326

On in vitro refolding by switching from chemotropic to kosmotropic conditions, the fusion partner is released from the C-terminal end of the autoprotease by self-cleavage, leaving CM4 protein with an authentic N terminus.

Their quality affects the refolding yield and further purification. Recent functional and structural studies have revealed that IBs are not dead-end aggregates but undergo dynamic changes, including aggregation, refunctionalization of the protein and proteolysis. Both, aggregation of the folding intermediates and turnover of IBs are influenced by the cellular situation and a number of well-studied chaperones and proteases are included. IBs mostly contain only minor impurities and are relatively homogenous. RESULTS: IBs of alpha-glucosidase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae after overproduction in Escherichia coli contain a large amount of (at least 12 different) major product fragments, as revealed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D PAGE). Matrix-Assisted-Laser-Desorption/Ionization-Time-Of-Flight Mass-Spectrometry (MALDI-ToF MS) identification showed that these fragments contain either the N- or the C-terminus of the protein, therefore indicate that these IBs are at least partially created by proteolytic action. Expression of alpha-glucosidase in single knockout mutants for the major proteases which are known to be included in the heat shock like response to production of recombinant proteins or to the degradation of IB proteins, clpP, lon, ompT, and ftsH did not influence the fragment pattern or the composition of the IBs. The quality of the IBs was also not influenced by the sampling time, cultivation medium (complex and mineral salt medium), production strategy (shake flask, fed-batch fermentation process), production strength (T5-lac or T7 promoter), strain background (K-12 or BL21), or addition of different protease inhibitors during IB preparation. CONCLUSIONS: The recombiannt alpha-glucosidase is fragmented before aggregation, but neither by proteolytic action on the IBs by the common major proteases, nor during downstream IB preparation. Different fragments co-aggregate in the process of IB formation together with the full-length product. Other intracellular proteases than ClpP or Lon must be responsible for fragmentation. Reaggregation of protease-stable alpha-glucosidase fragments during in situ disintegration of the existing IBs does not seem to occur.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20509924 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Jurgen B, Breitenstein A, Urlacher V, Buttner K, Lin H, Hecker M, Schweder T, Neubauer P</author>\n    <category>Microb Cell Fact</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20509924</guid>\n</item>	3	1276929540

High expression yields and simple recovery steps of inclusion bodies from the host cells are attractive features industrially. However, the value of an inclusion body-based process is dominated by the solubilization and refolding technologies. Scale-invariant technologies that are economical and applicable for a wide range of proteins are requested by industry. The main challenge is to convert the denatured protein into its native conformation at high yields. Refolding competes with misfolding and aggregation. Thus, the yield of native monomer depends strongly on the initial protein concentrations in the refolding solution. Reasonable yields are attained at low concentrations (&lt;/=0.1 mg/mL). However, large buffer tanks and time-consuming concentration steps are required. We attempt to answer the question of the extent to which refolding of proteins is protected by patents. Low-molecular mass additives have been developed to improve refolding yields through the stabilization of the protein in solution and shielding hydrophobic patches. Progress has been made in the field of high-pressure renaturation and on-column refolding. Mixing times of the denatured protein in the refolding buffer have been reduced using newly developed devices and the introduction of specific mixers. Concepts of continuous refolding have been introduced to reduce tank sizes and increase yields. Some of the patents covering refolding of proteins will soon expire or have already expired. This gives more freedom to operate.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20518058 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Eiberle MK, Jungbauer A</author>\n    <category>Biotechnol J</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20518058</guid>\n</item>	43	1277197389

However, experimental refolding studies demonstrate no observable alpha-helical intermediate during refolding of some b-sheet proteins, and have dampened enthusiasm for this model of protein folding. In this study, beta-sheet proteins were hypothesized to have potential to form amphiphilic helices at a period of &lt; 3.6 residues/turn that matches or exceeds the potential at 3.6 residues/turn. Hypothetically, such potential is the basis for an effective and unidirectional mechanism by which highly alpha-helical intermediates might be rapidly disassembled during folding, and potentially accounts for the difficulty in detecting highly alpha-helical intermediates during the folding of some proteins. The presence of this potential was confirmed, indicating that a model entailing ubiquitous formation of alpha-helical intermediates during the folding of globular proteins predicts previously unrecognized features of primary structure. Further, the folding of fatty acid binding protein, a predominantly beta-sheet protein which exhibits no apparent highly alpha-helical intermediate during folding, was dramatically accelerated by 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol, a solvent which stabilizes alpha-helical structure. This observation suggests that formation of alpha-helix can be a rate-limiting step during folding of a predominantly beta-sheet protein, and further supports the role of highly alpha-helical intermediates in the folding of all globular proteins.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20515035 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Chen E, Everett ML, Holzknecht ZE, Holzknecht RA, Lin SS, Bowles DE, Parker W</author>\n    <category>Biochemistry</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20515035</guid>\n</item>	0	1277345779

The toxin is secreted by H. pylori as an 88 kDa monomer (p88) consisting of two domains (p33 and p55). While an X-ray crystal structure for p55 exists and p88 oligomers have been visualized by cryo-electron microscopy, a detailed analysis of p33 has been hindered by an inability to purify this domain in an active form. In this study, we expressed and purified a recombinant form of p33 under denaturing conditions and optimized conditions for the refolding of soluble protein. We show that refolded p33 can be added to purified p55 in trans to cause vacuolation of HeLa cells and inhibition of IL-2 production by Jurkat cells, effects identical to those produced by the p88 toxin from H. pylori. The p33 protein markedly enhances the cell-binding properties of p55. Size exclusion chromatography experiments suggest that p33 and p55 assemble into a complex consistent with the size of a p88 monomer. Electron microscopy of these p33/p55 complexes reveals small rod-shaped structures that can convert to oligomeric flower-shaped structures in the presence of detergent. We propose that the oligomerization observed in these experiments mimics the process by which VacA oligomerizes when in contact with membranes of host cells.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20527875 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Gonzalez-Rivera C, Gangwer KA, McClain MS, Eli IM, Chambers MG, Ohi MD, Lacy DB, Cover TL</author>\n    <category>Biochemistry</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20527875</guid>\n</item>	22	1277958115

If no efficient refolding procedure is available, one is interested in obtaining as much product as possible in its soluble form. Here, we present a process engineering approach to maximizing the soluble target protein fraction. For that purpose, a dynamic process model was developed. Its essential kinetic component, the specific soluble product formation rate, if represented as a function of the specific growth rate and the culture temperature, depicts a clear maximum. Based on the dynamic model, optimal specific growth rate and temperature profiles for the fed-batch fermentation were determined. In the course of the study reported, the mass of desired soluble protein was increased by about 25%. At the same time, the formation of inclusion bodies was essentially avoided. As the optimal cultivation procedure is rather susceptible to distortions, control measures are necessary to guarantee that the real process can be kept on its desired path. This was possible with robust closed loop control.

The requirement of CD4 for viral entry has rationalized the development of recombinant CD4-based proteins as competitive viral attachment inhibitors and immunotherapeutic agents. In this study, we describe a novel recombinant CD4 protein designed to bind gp120 through a targeted disulfide-exchange mechanism. According to structural models of the gp120-CD4 receptor complex, substitution of S60 on the CD4 domain-1 a-helix with Cys positions a thiol in proximity of the gp120 V1/V2 loop disulphide (126C-C196), satisfying the stereochemical and geometric conditions for redox exchange between CD4 C60 and gp120 C126, and the consequent formation of an interchain disulphide bond. In this study, we provide experimental evidence for this effect by describing the expression, purification, refolding, receptor-binding and antiviral activity analysis of a recombinant 2-domain CD4 variant containing the S60C mutation (2dCD4-S60C). We show that 2dCD4-S60C binds HIV-1 gp120 with a significantly higher affinity than wild-type protein under conditions that facilitate disulfide exchange, and that this translates into a corresponding increase in the efficacy of CD4-mediated viral entry inhibition. We propose that targeted redox exchange between conserved gp120 disulfides and nucleophilic moieties positioned strategically on CD4 (or CD4-like scaffolds) conceptualizes a new strategy in the development of high-affinity HIV-1 Env ligands, with important implications for therapy and vaccine development. More generally, this chalcogen-substitution approach provides a general means of stabilizing receptor-ligand complexes where the structural and biophysical conditions for disulfide exchange are satisfied.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20538591 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Cerutti N, Mendelow BV, Napier GB, Papathanasopoulos MA, Killick M, Khati M, Stevens W, Capovilla A</author>\n    <category>J Biol Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20538591</guid>\n</item>	78	1278400772

Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) has been used to study the effects of several model protein stabilizers on the conformation of the unfolded state and early folding dynamics of tetramethyl rhodamine (TMR) labeled cytochrome c from Saccharomyces Cerevisiae at single molecular resolution. Special attention has been given to arginine, which is a widely used stabilizer for improving refolding yield of different proteins. The value of hydrodynamic radius (rH) obtained by analyzing the intensity fluctuations of the diffusing molecules has been found to increase in a two-state manner as the protein is unfolded by urea. The results further show that the presence of arginine and other protein stabilizers favor a relatively structured conformation of the unfolded states (rH of 29 A ) over an extended one (rH of 40 A), which forms in their absence. Also, the time constant of a kinetic component (tauR) of about 30 microsec has been observed by analyzing the correlation functions, which represents formation of a collapsed state. This time constant varies with urea concentration representing an inverted Chevron plot that shows a roll-over behavior in the absence of arginine.

Damaged proteins can form aggregates and have cytotoxic properties, a feature of many age-associated diseases. Small Hsps are chaperones involved in the refolding and/or disposal of protein aggregates. In Drosophila melanogaster, the mitochondrial DmHsp22 is preferentially upregulated during aging. Its over-expression results in an extension of lifespan (&gt;30%) and an increased resistance to stress. Although DmHsp22 has a chaperone-like activity in vitro, additional mechanisms by which it may extend lifespan in vivo are unknown. Genome-wide transcriptional analysis and comparative mitochondrial proteomic analysis by MALDI-TOF were performed to unveil differences in long-lived DmHsp22 over-expressing flies. Flies over-expressing DmHsp22 display an upregulation of genes normally downregulated with age and involved in energy production and protein biosynthesis. Interestingly, DmHsp22 over-expression extended lifespan of normal fibroblasts by slowing the aging process. However, its expression also increased the malignant properties of human transformed cells.

We can show that the refolding kinetics of the bistable RNA is modulated by urea, Mg2+ and spermidine by different mechanisms.

Like all negative-sense viruses, the segmented RNA genome of RVFV is encapsidated by a nucleocapsid protein (N). The 1.93-A crystal structure of RVFV N and electron micrographs of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) reveal an encapsidated genome of substantially different organization than in other negative-sense RNA virus families. The RNP polymer, viewed in electron micrographs of both virus RNP and RNP reconstituted from purified N with a defined RNA, has an extended structure without helical symmetry. N-RNA species of approximately 100-kDa apparent molecular weight and heterogeneous composition were obtained by exhaustive ribonuclease treatment of virus RNP, by recombinant expression of N, and by reconstitution from purified N and an RNA oligomer. RNA-free N, obtained by denaturation and refolding, has a novel all-helical fold that is compact and well ordered at both the N and C termini. Unlike N of other negative-sense RNA viruses, RVFV N has no positively charged surface cleft for RNA binding and no protruding termini or loops to stabilize a defined N-RNA oligomer or RNP helix. A potential protein interaction site was identified in a conserved hydrophobic pocket. The nonhelical appearance of phlebovirus RNP, the heterogeneous approximately 100-kDa N-RNA multimer, and the N fold differ substantially from the RNP and N of other negative-sense RNA virus families and provide valuable insights into the structure of the encapsidated phlebovirus genome.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20547879 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Raymond DD, Piper ME, Gerrard SR, Smith JL</author>\n    <category>Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20547879</guid>\n</item>	41	1279070484

We investigated the parallel production in a medium throughput strategy of genes coding for proteins from various marine organisms, using protocols that involved recombinatorial cloning, protein expression screening and batch purification. This strategy was applied in order to respond to the need for post-genomic validation of the recent success of a large number of marine genomic projects. Indeed, the upcoming challenge is to go beyond the bioinformatic data, since the bias introduced through the genomes of the so called model organisms leads to numerous proteins of unknown function in the still unexplored world of the oceanic organisms. RESULTS: We present here the results of expression tests for 192 targets using a 96-well plate format. Genes were PCR amplified and cloned in parallel into expression vectors pFO4 and pGEX-4T-1, in order to express proteins N-terminally fused to a six-histidine-tag and to a GST-tag, respectively. Small-scale expression and purification permitted isolation of 84 soluble proteins and 34 insoluble proteins, which could also be used in refolding assays. Selected examples of proteins expressed and purified to a larger scale are presented. CONCLUSIONS: The objective of this program was to get around the bottlenecks of soluble, active protein expression and crystallization for post-genomic validation of a number of proteins that come from various marine organisms. Multiplying the constructions, vectors and targets treated in parallel is important for the success of a medium throughput strategy and considerably increases the chances to get rapid access to pure and soluble protein samples, needed for the subsequent biochemical characterizations. Our set up of a medium throughput strategy applied to genes from marine organisms had a mean success rate of 44% soluble protein expression from marine bacteria, archaea as well as eukaryotic organisms. This success rate compares favorably with other protein screening projects, particularly for eukaryotic proteins. Several purified targets have already formed the base for experiments aimed at post-genomic validation.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20546566 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Groisillier A, Herve C, Jeudy A, Rebuffet E, Pluchon PF, Chevolot Y, Flament D, Geslin C, Morgado IM, Power D, Branno M, Moreau H, Michel G, Boyen C, Czjzek M</author>\n    <category>Microb Cell Fact</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20546566</guid>\n</item>	0	1279249504

We have already identified the gene encoding 4THase (Af-tth) in this bacterium. The heterologous expression of Af-tth in Escherichia coli resulted in the formation of inclusion bodies of the protein in an inactive form. The recombinant protein (Af-Tth) was successfully activated after an in vitro refolding treatment. The specific activity of the refolded Af-Tth obtained was 21.0+/-9.4 U mg(-1) when the protein solubilized from inclusion bodies by 6 M guanidine hydrochloride solution was refolded in a buffer containing 10 mM beta-alanine, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.4 M ammonium sulfate, and 30% v/v glycerol with the pH adjusted to 4.0 by sulfuric acid for 14 h at 4 degrees C. The in vitro refolding experiments revealed that Af-Tth required exposure to an acidic environment during protein folding for activation. This property reflects a physiological characteristic of the Af-Tth localized in the outer membrane of the acidophilic A. ferrooxidans. No cofactor such as pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) was required during the refolding process in spite of the similarity in the primary structure of Af-Tth to the PQQ family of proteins.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20546308 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Kanao T, Matsumoto C, Shiraga K, Yoshida K, Takada J, Kamimura K</author>\n    <category>FEMS Microbiol Lett</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20546308</guid>\n</item>	5	1279339427

However, large in vitro extensions of proteins that occur through a progressive unfolding of their domains typically dissipate a significant amount of energy, and therefore are not thermodynamically reversible. Some coiled-coil proteins have been found to stretch nearly reversibly, although their extension is typically limited to 2.5 times their folded length. Here, we report investigations on the mechanical properties of individual molecules of ankyrin-R, beta-catenin, and clathrin, which are representative examples of over 800 predicted human proteins composed of tightly packed alpha-helical repeats (termed ANK, ARM, or HEAT repeats, respectively) that form spiral-shaped protein domains. Using atomic force spectroscopy, we find that these polypeptides possess unprecedented stretch ratios on the order of 10-15, exceeding that of other proteins studied so far, and their extension and relaxation occurs with minimal energy dissipation. Their sequence-encoded elasticity is governed by stepwise unfolding of small repeats, which upon relaxation of the stretching force rapidly and forcefully refold, minimizing the hysteresis between the stretching and relaxing parts of the cycle. Thus, we identify a new class of proteins that behave as highly reversible nanosprings that have the potential to function as mechanosensors in cells and as building blocks in springy nanostructures. Our physical view of the protein component of cells as being comprised of predominantly inextensible structural elements under tension may need revision to incorporate springs.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20550922 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Kim M, Abdi K, Lee G, Rabbi M, Lee W, Yang M, Schofield CJ, Bennett V, Marszalek PE</author>\n    <category>Biophys J</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20550922</guid>\n</item>	1	1279616139

Experimental heating and cooling rates are usually much faster than rates of unfolding and refolding. In this work, collagen model peptides were used to study hysteresis quantitatively. Their unfolding and refolding profiles were recorded at different heating and cooling rates, and at different peptide concentrations. Data were fitted assuming kinetic mechanisms in which three chains combine to a helix with or without an intermediate that acts as a nucleus. A quantitative fit was achieved with the same kinetic model for the forward and backward reactions. Transitions of exogenously trimerized collagen models were also analyzed with a simplified kinetic mechanism. It follows that true equilibrium transitions can only be measured at high concentrations of polypeptide chains with slow scanning rates, for example, 0.1 degrees C/h at 0.25 mM peptide concentration of (Gly-Pro-Pro)(10). (Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)(10) folds approximately 2000 times faster than (Gly-Pro-Pro)(10). This was explained by a more stable nucleus, whereas the rate of propagation was almost equal. The analysis presented here can be used to derive kinetic and thermodynamic data for collagenous and other systems with kinetically controlled hysteresis.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20550913 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Mizuno K, Boudko SP, Engel J, BÃƒÂ¤chinger HP</author>\n    <category>Biophys J</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20550913</guid>\n</item>	5	1279766165

When combined with hydrogen deuterium exchange (HDX), details on protein stability and complex conformation can be obtained; however, complexes retained by ESI-MS are not always representative of those in solution and care must be taken in interpreting gas phase results. Zhu et al. [1] and Powell and Fitzgerald [2] have outlined LC-MS based techniques to probe the solution phase properties of the protein-ligand system in question. We here have taken the well characterised soluble immunophilin protein cyclophilin A, and examined it in complex with its endogenous ligand cyclosporin A. This ligand is widely used as an immunosuppressant following organ transplant, and the complex provides a basis for drug discovery efforts. We have used direct infusion, coupled with HDX, gas phase HDX and also the LC-HDX techniques PLIMSTEX and SUPREX. Results from each of these four HDX methodologies are presented here and discussed critically. From our direct infusion we find that there are 2 observable hydrogen populations in the protein, a very fast exchanging population, and a slower group. The exchange rate of both is lowered in the presence of the ligand. For PLIMSTEX we find a K(d) for ligand binding of 321+/-128nM, which is within one order of magnitude of values previously reported. SUPREX under a variety of conditions provides a range of K(d) values, but when we average these for experimental error we obtain a K(d) of 7.11+/-0.29nM which agrees well with measurements from other studies including via SUPREX. Finally gas phase HDX of the native complex shows more than 3 distinct populations of exchangeable hydrogens, for both the apo- and the holo protein consistent with an unfolding and refolding of the protein in the gas phase. The different techniques are compared with respect to the advantages and disadvantages they bring to the study of this protein-ligand system.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20557890 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Esswein ST, Florance HV, Baillie L, Lippens J, Barran PE</author>\n    <category>J Chromatogr A</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20557890</guid>\n</item>	21	1279859328

However, it is still challenging to identify the best position in order to avoid a loss of activity. By using an Nvoc-modification approach we facilitate the identification of a potential modification site as Nvoc can be removed in situ by UV irradiation and accordingly allows directly the comparison of the biological activity of the modified and the unmodified protein derived from the same precursor. As a test system, we used stromal cell-derived factor-1, which is involved in a wide range of physiological functions, mainly haematopoiesis and embryonic organ development. This chemokine is a potential candidate in regenerative medicine due to its capability to attract stem cells to distinct localizations. First, we synthesized the wildtype and the Nvoc-modified C-terminal segments SDF-1(50-68) and studied their secondary structure formation by circular dichroism spectroscopy. By using the IMPACT((R)) system we then expressed the peptide thioester M-[A(49)]-SDF-1(1-49)-MESNA recombinantly, in which the valine at position 49 was replaced by a more suitable alanine residue to allow improved cleavage and ligation. After ligation and refolding, the biological activity was proven in a cell-based IP(3) accumulation assay prior and after Nvoc removal, which showed that neither the alanine 49 nor the attached Nvoc group impair the activity of the analogue. The study shows, that lysine 56 is a potential site to introduce labels site-specifically in SDF-1. (c) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The analysis aims at investigating how local protein processes are affected by urea and how the perturbation by urea on the local level manifests itself in the kinetics of the global unfolding. The results show that the effect of urea on local processes depends upon the type of process at hand. An isolated two-residue contact on the surface of CI2 has a decreased frequency of rupture in the urea solvent. This is in contrast to the increased frequency of rupture of the hydrogen bonds in secondary structure elements in the urea solvent. It is proposed that the increase in the unfolding rates of complex protein processes is based upon the retardation of the refolding rate of small scale, isolated processes.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20570033 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Lindgren M, Westlund PO</author>\n    <category>Biophys Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20570033</guid>\n</item>	22	1280910125

Unlike most other viral fusion protein trimers, the monomers of GP64 are covalently linked to each other within the trimer by a single intermolecular disulfide bond (Cys24-Cys372). Single or paired alanine substitutions of Cys24 and Cys372 resulted in lower efficiency transport of GP64 to the cell surface. Surprisingly, these mutated GP64s induced syncytium formation and normalized fusion activities were approximately 30% of that from WT GP64. Heat treatment (37 degrees ) did not further reduce fusion activity of GP64 constructs with a disrupted intermolecular disulfide bond, suggesting that the GP64 trimers were relatively thermostable in the absence of the intermolecular disulfide bond. In addition, analysis of binding by a conformation-specific MAb suggested that the low-pH induced refolding of those GP64 constructs was generally similar to that of WT GP64. In addition to its critical role in membrane fusion, GP64 is also necessary for efficient budding. When GP64 constructs containing a disrupted intermolecular disulfide bond (Cys24-Cys372) were displayed at the cell surface at levels comparable to WT GP64, virion budding efficiency ranged from approximately 40-90%, indicating that the intermolecular disulfide bond is not required for virion budding. However, GP64 proteins with a disrupted intermolecular disulfide could not rescue a GP64null bacmid. We also examined the 6 conserved intramolecular disulfide bonds using single and paired alanine substitution mutations. None of the GP64 constructs with disrupted intramolecular disulfide bonds were capable of mediating pH-triggered membrane fusion, indicating that the intramolecular disulfide bonds are all necessary for membrane fusion. Thus, while the intramolecular disulfide bonds of GP64 appear to serve critical roles in membrane fusion, the unusual intermolecular disulfide bond was not critical for membrane fusion or virion budding yet appears to play an unknown role in viral infectivity.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20573818 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Li Z, Blissard GW</author>\n    <category>J Virol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20573818</guid>\n</item>	80	1281175566

The extracytoplasmic heat-shock factor DegP (HtrA) is a well-suited model for addressing mechanistic issues, as it is regulated by the common mechanisms of allostery and activation by oligomerization. Site-directed mutagenesis combined with refolding and oligomerization studies of chemically denatured DegP revealed how substrates trigger the conversion of the resting conformation into the active conformation. Binding of specific peptides to PDZ domain-1 causes a local rearrangement that is allosterically transmitted to the substrate-binding pocket of the protease domain. This activated state readily assembles into larger oligomeric particles, thus stabilizing the catalytically active form and providing a degradation cavity for protein substrates.

Fifteen salicylate-inducible proteins, which were previously unknown, have been identified. Unlike the roots, leaves accumulated some chloroplast proteins and enzymes capable of degrading the pathogen cell walls. In the roots, salicylic acid increased the content of enzymes, improving the resistance of plant cells themselves, and promoted the disappearance of reductase of oxophytodienic acid. The latter could lead to inhibition of jasmonic acid synthesis and stimulation of local immunity. High (apoptotic) concentration of salicylic acid intensified synthesis of root proteins involved in the formation of heteroprotein complexes, which play an important role in the functioning of the signaling system, DNA synthesis and repair, and protein synthesis, refolding, and proteolysis.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20586279 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author/>\n    <category>Prikl Biokhim Mikrobiol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20586279</guid>\n</item>	0	1281441734

Functional recombinant GRe-scFv was purified by cation exchange chromatography followed by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. The yield of purified GRe-scFv was 6.5 mg per 13 silkworm larvae, which is equivalent to 650 mg/l of the hemolymph, exhibiting extremely higher yield than that expressed in Escherichia coli (1.7 mg per liter of culture medium). It was revealed from characterization that GRe-scFv retained similar characteristic of the parental monoclonal antibody (MAb) against G-Re (MAb-4G10), making it possible to develop indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (icELISA) for quality control of total ginsenosides in various ginsengs.

The Keap1-mediated inhibition can be overcome by addition of xenobiotics or by overexpression of Nrf2 protein. The overexpressed Nrf2 overwhelms the Keap1 inhibition, translocates into the nucleus and activates antioxidant response element (ARE)-dependent gene transcription that protects the cell against oxidative stress.

The main goal of this work is the development of a methodology for the expression of the so far poorly characterized Carbohydrate Binding Module (CBM) of laforin, allowing its study and development of biomedical applications. The laforin's CBM sequence was originally cloned by PCR from a human muscle cDNA library. The recombinant protein, containing laforin's CBM fused to an Arg-Gly-Asp sequence (RGD), was cloned and expressed using vector pET29a and recovered as inclusion bodies (IBs). Refolding of the IBs allowed the purification of soluble, dimeric and functional protein, according to adsorption assays using starch and glycogen. Several other experimental approaches, using both bacteria and yeast, were unsuccessfully tested, pointing towards the difficulties in producing the heterologous protein.

Nonequilibrium work theorems such as Jarzynski equality and Crooks fluctuation theorem have been devised to recover free energy differences between states of this extended system. However, one is often more interested in the potential of mean force of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, i.e., in the effective potential dictating the equilibrium distribution of the collective coordinate in the absence of the external potential. In this respect, Hummer and Szabo proposed an algorithm to estimate the desired free energy differences when pulling experiments are performed in only one direction of the process ( Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2001, 98, 3658 ). In this paper, we present a potential of mean force estimator of the unperturbed system that exploits the work measured in both forward and backward directions of the process. The method is based on the reweighting technique of Hummer and Szabo and on the Bennett acceptance ratio. Using Brownian-dynamics simulations on a double-well free energy surface, we show that the estimator works satisfactorily in any pulling situation, from nearly equilibrium to strongly dissipative regimes. The method is also applied to the unfolding/refolding process of decaalanine, a system vastly used to illustrate and to test nonequilibrium methodologies. A thorough comparative analysis with another bidirectional potential of mean force estimator ( Minh, D. D. L.; Adib, A. B. Phys. Rev. Lett. 2008, 100, 180602 ) is also presented. The proposed approach is well-suited to recover free energy profiles from single-molecule bidirectional-pulling experiments such as those performed by optical tweezers or atomic force microscopes.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20597536 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Nicolini P, Procacci P, Chelli R</author>\n    <category>J Phys Chem B</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20597536</guid>\n</item>	0	1282020468

The folding properties that render a protein chaperonin dependent are not yet understood. Here, we address this question using a double mutant of the maltose-binding protein DM-MBP as a substrate. Upon spontaneous refolding, DM-MBP populates a kinetically trapped intermediate that is collapsed but structurally disordered. Introducing two long-range disulfide bonds into DM-MBP reduces the entropic folding barrier of this intermediate and strongly accelerates native state formation. Strikingly, steric confinement of the protein in the chaperonin cage mimics the kinetic effect of constraining disulfides on folding, in a manner mediated by negative charge clusters in the cage wall. These findings suggest that chaperonin dependence correlates with the tendency of proteins to populate entropically stabilized folding intermediates. The capacity to rescue proteins from such folding traps may explain the uniquely essential role of chaperonin cages within the cellular chaperone network.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20603018 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Chakraborty K, Chatila M, Sinha J, Shi Q, Poschner BC, Sikor M, Jiang G, Lamb DC, Hartl FU, Hayer-Hartl M</author>\n    <category>Cell</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20603018</guid>\n</item>	0	1282020468

The lens also contains high concentrations of the small heat shock chaperone alpha-crystallin, which suppresses aggregation of model substrates in vitro. Mature-onset cataract is believed to represent an aggregated state of partially unfolded and covalently damaged crystallins. Nonetheless, the lack of cell or tissue culture for anucleate lens fibers and the insoluble state of cataract proteins have made it difficult to identify the conformation of the human gamma-crystallin substrate species recognized by human alpha-crystallin. The three major human lens monomeric gamma-crystallins, gammaD, gammaC, and gammaS, all refold in vitro in the absence of chaperones, on dilution from denaturant into buffer. However, off-pathway aggregation of the partially folded intermediates competes with productive refolding. Incubation with human alphaB-crystallin chaperone during refolding suppressed the aggregation pathways of the three human gamma-crystallin proteins. The chaperone did not dissociate or refold the aggregated chains under these conditions. The alphaB-crystallin oligomers formed long-lived stable complexes with their gammaD-crystallin substrates. Using alpha-crystallin chaperone variants lacking tryptophans, we obtained fluorescence spectra of the chaperone-substrate complex. Binding of substrate gamma-crystallins with two or three of the four buried tryptophans replaced by phenylalanines showed that the bound substrate remained in a partially folded state with neither domain native-like. These in vitro results provide support for protein unfolding/protein aggregation models for cataract, with alpha-crystallin suppressing aggregation of damaged or unfolded proteins through early adulthood but becoming saturated with advancing age.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20621668 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Acosta-Sampson L, King J</author>\n    <category>J Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20621668</guid>\n</item>	42	1282020468

Design: The folding of ribonuclease A serves as a controlled energy-requiring system in which energy manipulation can be measured by the degree of folding achieved. A kinetic assay and fluorescence spectroscopy are used to assess the enzyme-folding state. Results: The data suggest that the kinetic assay is a useful means of assessing the degree of refolding, and specifically, the enzyme function. However, fluorescence spectroscopy was not shown to be an effective measurement of enzyme structure for the purposes of this work.

In this work, the influence of the anion of these organic salts on their performance as refolding enhancers was tested, using a series of N-ethyl N'-methyl imidazolium (EMIM) salts. Variation of the anion had a profound effect on the renaturation of the recombinant plasminogen activator rPA, which served as a model protein. The effect was roughly correlated with the stability of proteins in the tested aqueous ionic liquid solutions. Strongly destabilizing anions with higher alkyl substitutions like, e.g., hexyl sulfate were unable to promote protein refolding. However, the dimethyl and diethyl phosphate salts, which are known to be quite compatible with protein stability, also effectively suppressed renaturation, while alkylated sulfate anions with the same influence on protein stability did promote in vitro refolding. Only ionic liquid co-solvent systems with an intermediate capacity for solubilizing the proteinogenic amino acid tryptophan were found to permit effective renaturation of the model protein rPA.

The traditional process of influenza vaccine production in eggs is time consuming and may not meet the demands of rapid global vaccination required to curtail influenza pandemic. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Recombinant technology can be used to express the hemagglutinin (HA) of the emerging new influenza strain in a variety of systems including mammalian, insect, and bacterial cells. In this study, two forms of HA proteins derived from the currently circulating novel H1N1 A/California/07/2009 virus, HA1 (1-330) and HA (1-480), were expressed and purified from E. coli under controlled redox refolding conditions that favoured proper protein folding. However, only the recombinant HA1 (1-330) protein formed oligomers, including functional trimers that bound receptor and caused agglutination of human red blood cells. These proteins were used to vaccinate ferrets prior to challenge with the A/California/07/2009 virus. Both proteins induced neutralizing antibodies, and reduced viral loads in nasal washes. However, the HA1 (1-330) protein that had higher content of multimeric forms provided better protection from fever and weight loss at a lower vaccine dose compared with HA (1-480). Protein yield for the HA1 (1-330) ranged around 40 mg/Liter, while the HA (1-480) yield was 0.4-0.8 mg/Liter. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first study that describes production in bacterial system of properly folded functional globular HA1 domain trimers, lacking the HA2 transmembrane protein, that elicit potent neutralizing antibody responses following vaccination and protect ferrets from in vivo challenge. The combination of bacterial expression system with established quality control methods could provide a mechanism for rapid large scale production of influenza vaccines in the face of influenza pandemic threat.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20634959 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Khurana S, Verma S, Verma N, Crevar CJ, Carter DM, Manischewitz J, King LR, Ross TM, Golding H</author>\n    <category>PLoS One</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20634959</guid>\n</item>	7	1282622073

The exclusion volume effect of dextran and osmophobic effect of sucrose on HCK refolding can be counteracted by each other: sucrose bated the aggregation induced by dextran and increased the final reactivation yield and refolding rate of the slow track, while dextran inhibited the effect of sucrose to prevent aggregation and help correct folding. The effects of human cyclophilin 18 (hCyp18) and casein on folding of HCK were also studied in crowding conditions, and it was found that the chaperone function of hCyp18 was additive with sucrose but blocked by dextran, and that the aggregation-improving effect of casein was additive with dextran 70 but impaired by sucrose to certain extent.

An Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strain containing a pET-24a-HPPCn expression vector was cultivated in a 40-l bioreactor. High-cell-density fed-batch fermentation using this strain yielded a high concentration of rhHPPCn protein in the form of inclusion bodies.

Assessment of the biological activity of the obtained protein showed that rhHPPCn could attenuate the oxidative stress in ethanol-induced hepatocyte injury. We successfully achieved large-scale production of biologically active rhHPPCn protein and obtained yields greater than 40 mg rhHPPCn per gram dry cell weight by applying the above-mentioned renaturation and purification procedures.

A number of the most common neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are characterized by such abnormal protein folding and aggregation, and the induction of the heat shock response is observed in these cases through their increased expression and often localization within the inclusions. Tau proteins form the major structural component of the neurofibrillary protein aggregates that correlate with cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease, and appropriately this abnormal tau is targeted for corrective action by the heat shock proteins that recognize sequence motifs that are normally masked though microtubule binding. This specific heat shock response to the formation of abnormal tau can also be targeted pharmacologically to inhibit the refolding pathways and drive the degradation of tau species that are thought to be pathogenic.

In the present work, we have established a simple approach for the preparation of the mature human relaxin-3 peptide. We first designed and recombinantly expressed a single-chain relaxin-3 precursor in E. coli cells. After purification by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography, refolding in vitro through disulfide reshuffling, and digestion by endoproteinase Asp-N, mature human relaxin-3 was obtained in high yield and at low cost. Peptide mapping and circular dichroism spectroscopy studies suggested that the recombinant relaxin-3 adopted an insulin-like fold with the expected disulfide linkages. The recombinant mature relaxin-3 was fully active in both RXFP3 binding and activation assays. The activity of the single-chain precursor was very low, suggesting that a free C-terminus of the B-chain is necessary for receptor-binding and activation of relaxin-3. Our present work provides a highly efficient approach for the preparation of relaxin-3 as well as its analogues for functional and structural analyses.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20688116 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Luo X, Liu YL, Layfield S, Shao XX, Bathgate RA, Wade JD, Guo ZY</author>\n    <category>Peptides</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20688116</guid>\n</item>	41	1283234394

The activity of all family members is focused on membranes, but the proteins are themselves involved in a diverse range of phenomena. An overview of some of these phenomena is provided here, along with an historical perspective of CDCs themselves and how our understanding of their mechanism of action has developed over the years. The way in which pore formation depends on specific characteristics of the membrane under attack as well as of the protein doing the attacking is emphasised. The cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) have been the focus of a renewed keen research interest for over ten years now. Their importance has been even further enhanced by the homology now identified between them and the membrane attack complex/perforin (MACPF) family of proteins, which includes several components of the complement cascade as well as perforin itself. In this chapter I aim to provide an overview of our understanding of the interaction between CDCs and other members of what is now called the MACPF/CDC superfamily, with their target membranes. CDCs (also in the past known as thiol-activated toxins or cholesterol-binding toxins) were originally identified from four Gram-positive bacterial genera (Clostridium, Listeria, Bacillus and Streptococcus). Well-known examples include listeriolysin, perfringolysin, streptolysin and pneumoysin. Listeriolysin from L. monocytogenes is responsible for the escape of bacteria from the phagosome to colonise the cytoplasm and has been applied as a protein adjuvant in the development of vaccines against cancer and tuberculosis, for example. Perfringolysin from C. perfringens (Fig. 1A) has become perhaps the most studied CDC4 and has an important role in pathology associated with infection (gangrene). Streptolysin from S. pyogenes is another intensely studied CDC and has been applied widely in experimental permeabilisation of biological membranes. Pneumolysin is a major virulence determinant for S. pneumoniae, allowing bacterial invasion of tissues and mediating inflammation and the activation of the complement cascade. However, CDCs have now, for example, been identified in the bacteria Arcanobacterium pyogenes and Gardnerella vaginalis and there also appear to be homologues outside prokaryotes such as the sea anemone Metridium senile pore-forming toxin metridiolysin. The homology with the MACPF family was unknown until the first structures of the canonical fold of that family were solved, revealing the now characteristic MACPF/CDC fold of a twisted 3-sheet around which helices are clustered (Fig. 1A and D). Without any significant other sequence homology, the fold of this superfamily of pore-forming and membrane-binding proteins has been conserved by compensatory mutation around a handful of key conserved glycines. The glycines presumably act as critical hinges during the dramatic refolding that CDCs are known to undergo and which is presumably the selective advantage of this specific structure that has caused it to be conserved over such a vast evolutionary timescale. While not all MACPF domains are involved in pore formation-for example, C6 and C8beta--they are all apparently involved in action on membranes. The dramatic refolding undergone by CDCs is tightly coupled to their oligomerisation and results in the conversion of the helices hemming the core 3-sheet of the MACPF/CDC domain into a pair of beta-hairpins which in tandem and alongside those from other subunits within the oligomer insert into the membrane to create a pore (Fig. 1A-C). It is obviously the basic assumption that where nonCDC members of the superfamily-such as complement proteins and perforin-act on membranes they do so by a mechanism involving similar refolding.58 Even where a member of the MACPF/CDC superfamily is not known to form a pore, or has been shown not to-at least alone-the same conformational change could have other adaptive functions during activity on or at membranes. However, the bicomponent nature of some pore-forming toxins alerts us that showing an absence of activity for one pure protein does not mean that they do not contribute to pore formation quite directly, since that may require the presence of another MACPF/CDC family member or members from the same specific system. Complement acts by a combination of the C5b-8 complex of proteins preassembled on a target membrane recruiting C9 to form a lesion, which may be a complete ring of C9 associated with the C5b-8 or an arc-electron microscopy images show both possibilities.Perforin acts in concert with granzymes, to trigger apoptosis when delivered by cytotoxic cells at their targets (damaged, transformed and infected host cells). Incomplete rings are visible for perforin also and there are many unresolved issues concerning its mechanism and the dependence ofgranzymes on it for their delivery.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20687480 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Gilbert RJ</author>\n    <category>Adv Exp Med Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20687480</guid>\n</item>	0	1283408346

It has been proposed that neuroserpin polymers are formed by a conformational change of the folded protein. However, an alternative model has recently been proposed whereby polymers are formed during the protein folding rather than from the folded protein. We investigated the refolding and polymerization pathways of wild-type neuroserpin and the pathogenic mutants S49P and H338R. Upon refolding, denatured wild-type neuroserpin immediately formed an initial refolding intermediate, I(IN), and then underwent further refolding to the native form through a late refolding intermediate, I(R). The late-onset mutant S49P was also able to refold to the native form through I(IN) and I(R), but the final refolding step proceeded at a slower rate and with a lower refolding yield as compared with wild-type neuroserpin. The early-onset mutant H338R formed I(R) through the same pathway as S49P, but the protein could not attain the native state and remained as I(R). The I(R)s of the mutants had a long lifespan at 4(o)C, and thus were purified and characterized. Strikingly, when incubated under physiological conditions, I(R) formed ordered polymers with essentially the same properties as the polymers formed from the native protein. The results show that the mutants have a greater tendency to form polymers during the folding rather than from the folded protein. Our finding provides insights into biochemical approaches for the serpinopathies targeting a polymerogenic folding intermediate.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20691191 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Takehara S, Zhang J, Yang X, Takahashi N, Mikami B, Onda M</author>\n    <category>J Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20691191</guid>\n</item>	0	1283938038

This strictly glucose-dependent process renders the receptor and its ligands useful in the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus. To enable a biophysical characterization in vitro, we expressed the human full-length GLP-1R in the cytosol of Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies. After purification, refolding of the SDS-solubilized receptor was achieved by the exchange of SDS against the detergent Brij78 using an artificial chaperone system. Far-UV circular dichroism spectroscopic studies revealed the receptor to adopt a characteristic alpha-helical structure in Brij78 micelles. Ligand binding of the renatured protein was quantified by fluorescence quenching and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. In the presence of Brij micelles, refolded receptor binds the agonist exendin-4 with an apparent dissociation constant of approximately 100 nM in a reversible one-step mechanism. In order to demonstrate that the detected ligand binding activity is not due to an autonomously functional N-terminal domain (nGLP-1R) but also to additional contacts with the juxtamembrane part, we separately expressed and refolded the extracellular domain relying on identical protocols established for full-length GLP-1R. In support of the suggested multidomain binding mode, nGLP-1R binds exendin-4 with lower affinity (Kapp in the microM range) and a different kinetic mechanism. The lower ligand affinity of nGLP-1R entirely results from a decreased kinetic stability of the receptor-ligand complex the dissociation of which is ~40-fold faster in case of nGLP-1R compared to full-length GLP-1R. In summary, a framework was developed to produce functional human full-length GLP-1R by recombinant expression in E. coli as a prerequisite for eventual structure determination and a rigorous biophysical characterization including protein variants.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20690636 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Schroeder-Tittmann K, Bosse-Doenecke E, Reedtz-Runge S, Ihling CH, Sinz A, Tittmann K, Rudolph R</author>\n    <category>Biochemistry</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20690636</guid>\n</item>	44	1283938038

The intrinsic protein fluorescence suggested a putative intermediate state of protein in presence of 2 M guanidium hydrochloride (GdmCl) with an emission maximum of 353 nm. Here we studied the refolding of GdmCl-denatured alkaline xylanase in the presence and the absence of a multimeric chaperone protein alpha-crystallin to elucidate the molecular mechanism of intramolecular interactions of the alkaliphilic xylanase protein that dictates its extremophilic character. Our results, based on intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and hydrophobic fluorophore 8-anilino-1- naphthalene sulfonate-binding studies, suggest that alpha-crystallin formed a complex with a putative molten globule-like intermediate in the refolding pathway of xylanase in an ATP-independent manner. A 2 M GdmCl is sufficient to denature alkaline xylanase completely. The hydrodynamic radius (R(H)) of a native alkaline xylanase is 4.0, which becomes 5.0 in the presence of 2 M GdmCl whereas in presence of the higher concentration of GdmCl R(H) value was shifted to 100, indicating the aggregation of denatured xylanase. The alpha-crystallin.xylanase complex exhibited the recovery of functional activity with the extent of ~43%.

The autoprotease N(pro) and its engineered mutant EDDIE can be efficiently refolded on cation-exchangers. In the current work, denatured fusion proteins were loaded at different column saturations (5 and 50mgmL(-1) gel), and refolding and self-cleavage were initiated during elution. The contact time of the protein with the matrix significantly influenced the refolding rate and yield. On POROS 50 HS, the refolding rate was comparable to a batch refolding process, but yield was substantially higher; at a protein concentration of 1.55mgmL(-1), an almost complete conversion was observed. With Capto S, the rate of self-cleavage increased by a factor of 20 while yield was slightly reduced. Processing the autoprotease fusion protein on Capto S at a high protein loading of 50mgmL(-1) gel and short contact time (0.5h) yielded the highest productivity.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20708192 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Schmoeger E, Wellhoefer M, DÃƒÂ¼rauer A, Jungbauer A, Hahn R</author>\n    <category>J Chromatogr A</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20708192</guid>\n</item>	46	1284528520

Materials and methods: Male Wistar rats were immersed mid-sternum in a circulating water bath (42 degrees C for 30 min) to obtain a core body temperature of 41 degrees C; this process was repeated three times a week for 5 months. The blood was collected every month. Multiple parameters were examined for all rats including heat shock protein (Hsp70) level, serum glucose and insulin concentrations, advanced glycation end product (AGE) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) formation, lipid profile and antioxidant defence system. Additionally, the chaperoning capacity of glycated Hsp70 was evaluated based on in vitro studies in which the refolding of denatured luciferase was compared to refolding by native Hsp70. Results: HTT-treated diabetic rats showed a significant improvement in lipid profile, antioxidant capacity, insulin secretion and serum Hsp70 level and a significant decrease in AGE formation compared to the untreated diabetic rats. However, HTT had a borderline significant effect on weight and fasting blood glucose. Glycated Hsp70 lost its chaperoning ability to reactivate the denatured luciferase. Conclusion: A decrease in complications in diabetic rats after hot-tub therapy is shown here. An increase in the extracellular Hsp70 level due to HTT was observed. This increase may serve to protect the structure of proteins (e.g. preventing AGE formation), and the observed beneficial effects may be related to it.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20707652 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Bathaie SZ, Jafarnejad A, Hosseinkhani S, Nakhjavani M</author>\n    <category>Int J Hyperthermia</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20707652</guid>\n</item>	7	1284616355

These stresses impose a burden on protein folding and degradation pathways and suggest a route for therapeutic intervention in cancer. Proteasome and Hsp90 inhibitors are in clinical trials and a 20S proteasome inhibitor, Velcade, is an approved drug. Other points of intervention in the folding and degradation pathway may therefore be of interest. We describe a simple screen for inhibitors of protein synthesis, folding, and proteasomal degradation pathways in this paper. The molecular chaperone-dependent client v-Src was fused to firefly luciferase and expressed in HCT-116 colorectal tumor cells. Both luciferase and protein tyrosine kinase activity were preserved in cells expressing this fusion construct. Exposing these cells to the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin caused a rapid reduction of luciferase and kinase activities and depletion of detergent-soluble v-Src::luciferase fusion protein. Hsp70 knockdown reduced v-Src::luciferase activity and, when combined with geldanamycin, caused a buildup of v-Src::luciferase and ubiquitinated proteins in a detergent-insoluble fraction. Proteasome inhibitors also decreased luciferase activity and caused a buildup of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins in a detergent-insoluble fraction. Protein synthesis inhibitors also reduced luciferase activity, but had less of an effect on phosphotyrosine levels. In contrast, certain histone deacetylase inhibitors increased luciferase and phosphotyrosine activity. A mass screen led to the identification of Hsp90 inhibitors, ubiquitin pathway inhibitors, inhibitors of Hsp70/Hsp40-mediated refolding, and protein synthesis inhibitors. The largest group of compounds identified in the screen increased luciferase activity, and some of these increase v-Src levels and activity. When used in conjunction with appropriate secondary assays, this screen is a powerful cell-based tool for studying compounds that affect protein synthesis, folding, and degradation.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20717760 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Boschelli F, Golas JM, Petersen R, Lau V, Chen L, Tkach D, Zhao Q, Fruhling DS, Liu H, Nam C, Arndt KT</author>\n    <category>Cell Stress Chaperones</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20717760</guid>\n</item>	0	1284704340

Artificial molecular chaperone (AMC) and protein folding liquid chromatography (PFLC) are two attractive refolding methods developed in recent years. In the present work, AMC and one branch of PFLC, ion exchange chromatography (IEC), are integrated to form a new refolding method, artificial molecular chaperone-ion exchange chromatography (AMC-IEC). This new method is applied to the refolding of a widely used model protein, urea-denatured/dithiothreitol-reduced lysozyme. Many factors influencing the refolding of lysozyme, such as urea concentration, beta-cyclodextrin concentration, molar ratio of detergent to protein, mobile phase flow rate, and type of detergent, were investigated, respectively, to optimize the conditions for lysozyme refolding by AMC-IEC. Compared with normal IEC refolding method, the activity recoveries of lysozyme obtained by AMC-IEC were much higher in the investigated range of initial protein concentrations. Moreover, the activity recoveries obtained by using this newly developed refolding method were still quite high for denatured/reduced lysozyme at high initial concentrations. When the initial protein concentration was 200 mg mL(-1), the activity recovery was over 60%. In addition, the lifetime of the chromatographic column during AMC-IEC was much longer than that during protein refolding by normal IEC. Therefore, AMC-IEC is a high efficient and low cost protein refolding method. (c) 2010 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

Such cooperativity results in unfolding curves that are typically sigmoidal. However, we still do not know what factors modulate folding cooperativity, or what is the minimal amount that ensures folding into specific three-dimensional structures. Here we address these issues on BBL, a small helical protein that folds in microseconds via a marginally cooperative downhill process (Li,P., Oliva,F.Y., Naganathan, A.N., Munoz, V. (2009) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 106, 103-108). Particularly, we explore the effects of salt-induced screening of the electrostatic interactions in BBL at neutral pH and in acid-denatured BBL. Our results show that electrostatic screening stabilizes the native state of the neutral and protonated forms, inducing complete refolding of acid-denatured BBL. Furthermore, without net electrostatic interactions the unfolding process becomes much less cooperative, as judged by the broadness of the equilibrium unfolding curve and the relaxation rate. Our experiments show that the marginally cooperative unfolding of BBL can still be made twice as broad while the protein retains its ability to fold into the native 3D structure in microseconds. This result demonstrates experimentally that efficient folding does not require cooperativity, confirming predictions from theory and computer simulations, and challenging the conventional biochemical paradigm. Furthermore, we conclude that electrostatic interactions are an important factor in determining folding cooperativity. Thus, electrostatic modulation by pH-salt and/or mutagenesis of charged residues emerges as an attractive tool for tuning folding cooperativity.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20729560 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Desai TM, Cerminara M, Sadqi M, Munoz V</author>\n    <category>J Biol Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20729560</guid>\n</item>	0	1284796311

Although CMP homotrimers have been widely studied, very little work has been reported regarding CMP heterotrimers because of synthetic difficulties. Here we present the synthesis and characterization of homotrimers and ABB type heterotrimers comprising natural and synthetic CMP sequences that are covalently tethered to a template, a tris(2-aminoethyl) amine (TREN) succinic acid derivative. Various tethered heterotrimers comprising synthetic CMPs [(ProHypGly)(6), (ProProGly)(6)] and CMPs representing specific domains of type I collagen were synthesized and characterized in terms of triple helical structure, thermal melting behavior and refolding kinetics. The results indicated that CMPs derived from natural type I collagen sequence can form stable heterotrimeric helical complexes with artificial CMPs and that the thermal stability and the folding rate increase with the increasing number of helical stabilizing amino acids (e.g. Hyp) in the peptide chains. Covalent tethering enhanced the thermal stability and refolding kinetics of all CMPs; however their relative values were not affected suggesting that the tethered system can be used for comparative study of heterotrimeric CMP's folding behavior in regards to chain composition and for characterization of thermally unstable CMPs.

The experimental setup was designed to achieve a robust and as universal method which should allow optimizing the folding of a variety of proteins with the same routine procedure guided by the genetic algorithm. In the screen, we incorporated a large number of common refolding additives and conditions. Using this design, the refolding of four structurally and functionally different model proteins was optimized experimentally, achieving 74 to 100 % refolding yield for all of them.

Since then, many efforts have been made to optimise this technique and, recently, to adapt it to membrane protein production with yields compatible with structural investigations. The versatility of the method allows membrane proteins to be obtained directly stabilised in surfactant micelles or inserted in a lipidic environment (proteoliposome, bicelle, nanodisc) at the end of synthesis. Among the surfactants used, non-detergent ones such as fluorinated surfactants proved to be a good alternative in terms of colloidal stability and preservation of the integrity of membrane proteins, as shown for E. coli homo-pentameric channel, MscL (Berrier et al., Biochem. J., 403: 183-7). Here we report cell-free expression of E. coli leader peptidase (a transmembrane protease), H. salinarium bacteriorhodopsin (a transmembrane protein binding a hydrophobic co-factor) and E. coli MscL in the presence of non-detergent surfactants, amphipols and fluorinated surfactants in comparison to their expression in classical detergents. The results confirm the potentialities of fluorinated surfactants and, although pointing to limitations in using the first generations amphipols, results are discussed in the light of membrane protein refolding, especially in the case of bacteriorhodopsin.

Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli using an expression system comprising the autoprotease N(pro) from Pestivirus, or its engineered mutant called EDDIE, with C-terminally linked target proteins. Upon refolding, the autoprotease became active and cleaved off its fusion partner, forming an authentic N-terminus. Peptide ligands binding to the autoprotease at 4M urea were screened from a combinatorial peptide library. A group of positive peptides were identified and further refined by mutational analysis. The best binders represent a common motif comprising positively charged and aromatic amino acids, which can be distributed in a random disposition. Mutational analysis showed that exchange of a single amino acid within the peptide ligand caused a total loss of binding activity. Functional affinity media comprising hexa- or octapeptides were synthesized using a 15-atom spacer with terminal sulfhydryl function and site-directed immobilization of peptides derivatized with iodoacetic anhydride. The peptide size was further reduced to dipeptides comprising only one positively charged and one aromatic amino acid. Based on this, affinity media were prepared by immobilization of a poly amino acid comprising lysine or arginine, and tryptophan, phenylalanine, or tyrosine, respectively, in certain ratios.

The first step in the folding of lambda lysozyme occurs very rapidly (tau &lt; 1 ms) after refolding is initiated and involves both hydrophobic collapse and formation of a high content of secondary structure, but only weak protection from 1H/2H exchange and no fixed tertiary structure organization. This early folding step is reflected in the dead-time events observed in the far-UV CD and ANS fluorescence experiments. Following accumulation of this kinetic molten globule species, the secondary structural elements are stabilized and the majority (ca. 88%) of refolding molecules acquire native-like properties in a highly cooperative two-state process, with tau = 0.15 +/- 0.03 s. This is accompanied by the acquisition of substantial native-like protection from hydrogen exchange. A double-mixing experiment and the absence of a denaturant effect reveal that slow (tau = 5 +/- 1 s) folding of the remaining (ca. 12%) molecules is rate limited by the cis/trans isomerization of prolines that are trans in the folded enzyme. In addition, native state hydrogen exchange and classical denaturant unfolding experiments have been used to characterize the thermodynamic properties of the enzyme. In good agreement with previous crystallographic evidence, our results show that lambda lysozyme is a highly dynamic protein, with relatively low conformational stability (DeltaG degrees N-U = 25 +/- 2 kJ*mol-1).</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20806781 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Di Paolo A, Balbeur D, De Pauw E, Redfield C, Matagne A</author>\n    <category>Biochemistry</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20806781</guid>\n</item>	35	1285139066

Observation of the effects of mutations helps account for sequence-specific properties and large variations in folding rates observed in homologous proteins, which are not explained by structure-derived descriptions. The folding kinetics of variants of a b-stranded protein, toxin a from Naja nigricollis, depends on the length of their loop lk1. These proteins, named Tox60, Tox61 and Tox62, contain four disulfide bonds. We show that their oxidative refolding pathways are similar. Differences in these pathways are restricted to the last step of the reaction i.e. the closure of the last disulfide. At this step, two species of three disulfide intermediates are observed: intermediate C lacking the B3 disulfide and intermediate D lacking the B2 disulfide. Surprisingly, D is the most productive intermediate for Tox61 despite the low accessibility of its free cysteines. However, in the case of Tox62, its conversion efficiency drops by two orders of magnitude and C becomes the most productive intermediate. NMR was used in order to study the structural dynamics of each of these intermediates. Both three disulfide intermediates of Tox61 exist in two forms exchanging on the 1-100 millisecond scale. One of these forms is structurally very close to the native Tox61 whereas the other is always significantly more flexible on a picosecond to nanosecond timescale. On the other hand, in the case of Tox62, the three disulfide intermediates only show a native-like structure. The higher conformational heterogeneity of Tox61 intermediate D allows an increased accessibility of its free cysteines to oxidative agents, which explains its faster native disulfide formation. Thus, residue deletion in loop lk1 probably abrogates stabilizing intramolecular interactions, creates conformational heterogeneity and increases the folding rate of Tox60 and Tox61 compared to Tox62.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20804768 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Gross G, Gallopin M, Vandame M, Couprie J, Stura E, Zinn-Justin S, Drevet P</author>\n    <category>J Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20804768</guid>\n</item>	2	1285228042

Contrarily, fusion toxins exhibit remarkable tumor specificity thus emerging as an alternative therapy for the treatment of cancer. Diphtheria toxin-HN-1 peptide (DT/HN-1) is a fusion toxin designed to target the head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The aim of this study was to construct, characterize, and evaluate the cytotoxicity and specificity of DT/HN-1 fusion toxin against the HNSCC cells. The purified DT/HN-1 fusion toxin was characterized by SDS-PAGE and western blotting. Refolding of purified fusion toxins was monitored by fluorescence spectra and circular dichroism spectra. The activity of DT/HN-1 fusion toxin was demonstrated on various HNSCC cell lines by cell viability assay, cell proliferation assay, protein synthesis inhibition assay, apoptosis and cell cycle analysis. The fusion toxin DT/HN-1 demonstrated remarkably high degree of cytotoxicity specific to the HNSCC cells. The IC(50) of DT/HN-1 fusion toxin was ~1 to 5 nM in all the three HNSCC cell lines. The percentage apoptotic cells in DT/HN-1 treated UMB-SCC-745 cells are 16% compared to 4% in untreated. To further demonstrate the specific toxicity of DT/HN-1 fusion toxin towards the HNSCC cells we constructed, characterized and evaluated the efficacy of DT protein. The DT protein coding for only a fragment of diphtheria toxin without its native receptor binding domain failed to exhibit any cytotoxicity on all the cell lines used in this study thus establishing the importance of a ligand in achieving targeted toxicity. To evaluate the translocation ability of HN-1 peptide, an additional construct DTDeltaT/HN-1 was constructed, characterized and evaluated for its cytotoxic activity. The fusion toxin DTDeltaT/HN-1 deficient of the translocation domain of diphtheria toxin showed no cytotoxicity on all the cell lines clearly indicating the inability of HN-1 peptide to translocate catalytic domain of the toxin into the cytosol.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20814829 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Potala S, Verma RS</author>\n    <category>Mol Biol Rep</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20814829</guid>\n</item>	6	1285228042

Membrane (M) and envelope (E) proteins are major structural proteins of the SARS-CoV. The M protein has been determined as a protective antigen in humoral responses. However, its potential roles in stimulating cellular immunity remain elusive. Methods.Ã¢Â€Âƒ In this study, a panel of peptides derived from M and E proteins were tested by in vitro refolding, T2 cell-binding assays, and responses stimulated by cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes in HLA-A2.1/K(b) transgenic mice and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Results.Ã¢Â€Âƒ A nonameric epitope Mn2 and a decameric epitope Md3 derived from the M protein were identified and used for the evaluation of M protein-specific immunity. Responses stimulated by M protein-specific CTL epitopes have been found in the PBMCs of donors who had recovered from SARS infection. Additionally, the transmembrane domain of the M protein may contain a T cell epitope cluster revealed by the immunogenic and structural analysis of a panel of truncated peptides overlapping with Mn2 and Md3. Conclusions.Ã¢Â€Âƒ The M protein of SARS-CoV holds dominant cellular immunogenicity. This, together with previous reports of a strong humoral response against the M protein, may help to further explain the immunogenicity of SARS and serves as potential targets for SARS-CoV vaccine design.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20831383 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Liu J, Sun Y, Qi J, Chu F, Wu H, Gao F, Li T, Yan J, Gao GF</author>\n    <category>J Infect Dis</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20831383</guid>\n</item>	74	1285826064

While the fluorescence measurements are unable to detect structural changes preceding the rate-limiting step of folding, measurements of changes in ANS fluorescence and FRET efficiency indicate that polypeptide chain collapse precedes the major structural transition. It is shown that the initial chain collapse reaction is complete within 150 Ã‚Âµs. The collapsed form at this time possesses hydrophobic clusters to which ANS binds. Each of the three measured intra-molecular distances has contracted to an extent predicted by the dependence of the FRET signal in completely unfolded protein on denaturant concentration, indicating that contraction is non-specific. The extent of contraction of each intra-molecular distance in the collapsed product of sub-ms folding increases continuously with a decrease in GdnHCl concentration. The gradual contraction is continuous with the gradual contraction seen in completely unfolded protein, and its dependence on GdnHCl concentration is not indicative of an all-or-none collapse reaction. It is seen that the dependence of the extent of contraction on GdnHCl concentration is similar for the three distances, which indicates that chain collapse occurs in a synchronous manner across different segments of the polypeptide chain. The sub-ms measurements of folding in GdnHCl are unable to determine whether hydrophobic cluster formation, probed by ANS fluorescence measurement, precedes chain contraction probed by FRET. To determine whether hydrogen bonding might play a role in initial chain collapse, folding was also initiated by dilution of the urea-unfolded state. The extent of contraction of at least one intra-molecular distance in the collapsed product of sub-ms folding in urea is similar to that seen in GdnHCl, and the initial contraction in urea too appears gradual in nature.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20837026 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Dasgupta A, Udgaonkar JB</author>\n    <category>J Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20837026</guid>\n</item>	1	1285821074

Aging is characterized by increased oxidative stress and the accumulation of abnormal (malfolded) proteins, and these stresses induce Hsp gene expression through the transcription factor HSF. In addition, a subset of Hsps is induced by oxidative stress through the JNK signaling pathway and the transcription factor Foxo. The Hsps counteract the toxicity of abnormal proteins by facilitating protein refolding and turnover, and through other mechanisms including inhibition of apoptosis. The Hsps are up-regulated in tissue-specific patterns during aging, and their expression correlates with, and sometimes predicts, life span, making them ideal biomarkers of aging.

Here, a SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein-derived CTL epitope N1, QFKDNVILL, restricted by HLA-A*2402 were identified by a series of in vitro studies including computer-assisted algorithm for prediction, stabilization of the peptide by co-refolding with HLA-A*2402 heavy chain and ÃŽÂ²2m, and T2-A24 cell binding. Consequently, antigenicity of the peptide was confirmed by ELISPOT, proliferating assays and HLA-peptide complex tetramer staining using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from SARS-recovered donors. Furthermore, the crystal structure of HLA-A*2402 complexed with Peptide N1 was determined and the featured peptide is characterized with two unexpected intra-chain hydrogen-bonds which augment the central residues to become bulged out of the binding groove. This may contribute to the T cell receptor (TCR) interaction, showing a host immunodominant peptide presentation strategy.

A specific subfamily of heat shock proteins is formed by the HSPB family of molecular chaperones, which comprises 10 members (HSPB1-10, also called small HSP). Several of them are known to act as anti-aggregation proteins in vitro. Whether they also act protectively in cells against polyglutamine aggregation has so far only been studied for few of them (e.g. HSPB1, HSPB5 and HSPB8). Here, we compared the 10 members of the human HSPB family for their ability to prevent aggregation of disease-associated proteins with an expanded polyQ stretch. HSPB7 was identified as the most active member within the HSPB family. It not only suppressed polyQ aggregation but also prevented polyglutamine induced toxicity in cells and its expression reduces eye-degeneration in a Drosophila polyQ model. Upon overexpression in cells, HSPB7 was not found in larger oligomeric species when expressed in cells and ÃƒÂunlike HSPB1- it did not improve the refolding of heat-denatured luciferase. The action of HSPB7 was also not dependent on the Hsp70 machine or on proteasomal activity and HSPB7 overexpression alone did not increase autophagy. However, in ATG5-/- cells that are defective in macroautophagy, the anti-aggregation activity of HSPB7 was substantially reduced. So, HSPB7 prevents toxicity of polyQ proteins at an early stage of aggregate formation by a non-canonical mechanism that requires an active autophagy machinery.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20843828 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Vos MJ, Zijlstra MP, Kanon B, van Waarde-Verhagen MA, Brunt ER, Oosterveld-Hut HM, Carra S, Sibon OC, Kampinga HH</author>\n    <category>Hum Mol Genet</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20843828</guid>\n</item>	6	1286268609

However, understanding mechanisms by which tumors evade elimination by the immune system of the host presents a significant challenge for developing effective cancer immunotherapies. The interaction of cancer cells with the host is a complex process that is distributed across a variety of time and length scales. The time scales range from the dynamics of protein refolding (i.e., microseconds) to the dynamics of disease progression (i.e., years). The length scales span the farthest reaches of the human body (i.e., meters) down to the range of molecular interactions (i.e., nanometers). A limited range of time and length scales is used experimentally to observe and quantify changes in physiology due to cancer. Translating knowledge obtained from the limited scales observed experimentally to predict patient response is an essential prerequisite for the rational design of cancer immunotherapies that improve clinical outcomes. In studying multiscale systems, engineers use systems analysis and design to identify important components in a complex system and to test conceptual understanding of the integrated system behavior using simulation. The objective of this review is to summarize interactions between the tumor and cell-mediated immunity from a multiscale perspective. The role of Interleukin-12 in coordinating antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity is used illustrate the different time and length scale that underpin cancer immunoediting. An underlying theme in this review is the potential role that simulation can play in translating knowledge across scales.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20843320 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Klinke DJ</author>\n    <category>Mol Cancer</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20843320</guid>\n</item>	0	1286268609

In neurons, the Hsp70s and their Hsp40-like J-domain co-chaperones are the only known components of chaperone network that can use ATP to convert cytotoxic protein aggregates into harmless natively refolded polypeptides. Here, we developed a protocol for preparing a homogeneous population of highly stable ÃŽÂ² sheet enriched toroid-shaped ÃŽÂ± Syn oligomers with a diameter typical of toxic pore-forming oligomers. These oligomers were partially resistant to in vitro unfolding by the bacterial Hsp70 chaperone system (DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE). Moreover, both bacterial and human Hsp70/Hp40 unfolding/refolding activity of model chaperone substrates were strongly inhibited by the oligomers, but, remarkably, not by unstructured ÃŽÂ± Syn monomers even in large excess. The oligomers acted as a specific competitive inhibitor of the J domain co chaperones, indicating that J-domain co chaperones may preferably bind to exposed bulky misfolded structures in misfolded proteins and thus complement Hsp70s that bind to extended segments. Together, our findings suggest that inhibition of the Hsp70/40 chaperone system by ÃŽÂ± Syn oligomers may contribute to the disruption of protein homeostasis in dopaminergic neurons, leading to apoptosis and tissue loss in PD and related neurodegenerative diseases.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20847048 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Hinault MP, Farina-Henriquez-Cuendet A, Mattoo RU, Mensi M, Dietler G, Lashuel HA, Goloubinoff P</author>\n    <category>J Biol Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20847048</guid>\n</item>	22	1286248664

Frequently, proteins are recovered as insoluble inclusion bodies and need to be denatured and refolded into the correct structure. To address this, a refolding screening process based on a 96-well assay format supported by Design of Experiments (DOE) was developed for identification of optimal refolding conditions. After a first generic screen of 96 different refolding conditions the parameters that produced the best yield were further explored in a focused DOE-based screen. The refolding efficiency and the quality of the refolded protein were analyzed by RP-HPLC and SDS-PAGE. The results were analyzed by the DOE software to identify the optimal concentrations of the critical additives. The optimal refolding conditions suggested by DOE were verified in medium scale refolding tests, which confirmed the reliability of the predictions. Finally, the refolded protein was purified and its biologic activity was tested in vitro. The screen was applied for the refolding of Interleukin 17F (IL-17F), stromal-cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1ÃŽÂ±/CXCL12), B cell-attracting chemokine 1 (BCA-1/CXCL13), granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and the complement factor C5a. This procedure identified refolding conditions for all the tested proteins. For the proteins where refolding conditions were already available, the optimized conditions identified in the screening process increased the yields between 50 and 100%. Thus, the method described here is a useful tool to determine the feasibility of refolding and to identify high-yield scalable refolding conditions optimized for each individual protein.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20851186 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Dechavanne V, Barrillat N, Borlat F, Hermant A, Magnenat L, Paquet M, Antonsson B, Chevalet L</author>\n    <category>Protein Expr Purif</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20851186</guid>\n</item>	5	1286436029

A custom-built flow device with three sequential mixing steps is used for (i) triggering protein folding, (ii) pulsed D(2)O labeling, and (iii) acid quenching. The earliest folding time point that can be studied with this system is 10 ms. The mixing device was coupled online to the electrospray source of a Fourier transform mass spectrometer, where intact protein ions are fragmented by electron capture dissociation (ECD). The viability of this experimental strategy is demonstrated by applying it to the refolding of horse apo-myoglobin (aMb), a reaction known to involve a transient intermediate. Cooling of the mixing device to 0 Ã‚Â°C reduces the reaction rate such that the folding process occurs within the experimentally accessible time window. Top-down ECD provides an average spatial resolution of ca. 2 residues, surpassing the resolution typically achieved in traditional proteolytic digestion/HDX studies. Amide back exchange is virtually eliminated by the short (Ã¢ÂˆÂ¼1 s) duration of the acid quenching step. The aMb folding intermediate exhibits HDX protection in helices G and H, whereas the remainder of the protein is largely unfolded. Marginal protection is seen for helix A. Overall, the top-down ECD approach used here offers insights into the sequence of events leading from the unfolded state to the native conformation, with envisioned future applications in the areas of protein misfolding and aggregation. The time-resolved experiments reported herein represent an extension of our previous work, where HDX/MS with top-down ECD was employed for monitoring "static" protein structures under equilibrium conditions (Pan et al.

Refolding kinetics using gemini disulfide detergents differing in their hydrophobicity were analysed to determine the folding and aggregation rate constants.

Further addition of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) with CTAB drastically increased the refolding yield up to 35%, a value which was higher than the simple sum of the refolding yields in the presence of only CTAB or DMSO. The synergistic enhancement was also observed in the coexistence of other detergents, such as polyethylene glycol monooleyl ether (n=50) and N-tetradecyl-N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propanesulfonate, and cosolvents, such as N,N-dimethylformamide and N,N-dimethylacetamide.

The disease is caused by mutations in either EPM2A gene, encoding the protein phosphatase, laforin or EPM2B gene, encoding the ubiquitin ligase, malin. But how mutations in these two genes cause disease pathogenesis is poorly understood. In this study, we show that the Lafora bodies in axillary skin and brain stain positively for the ubiquitin, the 20S proteasome and the molecular chaperones Hsp70/Hsc70. Interestingly, mutant malins that are misfolded also frequently colocalizes with Lafora bodies in skin biopsy sample of respective LD patient. The expression of disease causing mutations of malin in Cos-7 cells results in the formation of profuse cytoplasmic aggregates that colocalize with Hsp70/Hsc70 chaperones and 20S proteasome. The mutant malin expressing cells also exhibit proteasomal dysfunction and cell death. Overexpression of Hsp70 decreases the frequency of mutant malin aggregation and protects from mutant malin-induced cell death. These finding suggest that Lafora bodies are consisting of abnormal proteins including mutant malin, targeted by chaperones or proteasome for their refolding or clearance, and failure of these quality control systems could lead to LD pathogenesis. Our data also indicates that the Hsp70 chaperone could be a potential therapeutic target of LD.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20858601 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Rao SN, Maity R, Sharma J, Dey P, Shankar SK, Satishchandra P, Jana NR</author>\n    <category>Hum Mol Genet</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20858601</guid>\n</item>	6	1286885876

Cells maintain a complete set of functionally competent proteins normally and in the face of injury or environmental stress with the use of various mechanisms, including systems of proteins called molecular chaperones. Proteins that are denatured by any form of proteotoxic stress are cooperatively recognized by heat shock proteins (HSP) and directed for refolding or degradation. Under non-denaturing conditions HSP have important functions in cell physiology such as in transmembrane protein transport and in enabling assembly and folding of newly synthesized polypeptides. Besides cellular molecular chaperones, which are stress-induced proteins, there have been recently reported chemical, or so-called pharmacological chaperones with demonstrated ability to be effective in preventing misfolding of different disease causing proteins, specifically in the therapeutic management of sight-threatening eye diseases, essentially reducing the severity of several neurodegenerative disorders (such as age-related macular degeneration), cataract and many other protein-misfolding diseases.

How do such vectorial constraints impact the folding pathway? Here, we combine single-molecule atomic force spectroscopy and steered molecular dynamics simulations to examine protein folding in the presence of 1D constraints that are similar to those imposed on the NPC. The simulations exquisitely reproduced the experimental unfolding and refolding force extension relationships and led to the full reconstruction of the vectorial folding pathway of a large polypeptide, the 253-residue consensus ankyrin repeat protein, NI6C. We show that fully stretched and then relaxed NI6C starts folding by the formation of local secondary structures followed by the nucleation of three N-terminal repeats. This rate-limiting step is then followed by the vectorial and sequential folding of the remaining repeats. However, after partial unfolding, when allowed to refold, the C-terminal repeats successively regained structures without any nucleation step, by using the intact N terminal repeats as a template. These results suggest a pathway for the co-translational folding of repeat proteins and have implications for mechanotransduction.q.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20870713 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Lee W, Zeng X, Zhou HX, Bennett V, Yang W, Marszalek PE</author>\n    <category>J Biol Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20870713</guid>\n</item>	0	1286949111

This switch-like behaviour was first observed on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120, where it plays a crucial role in the efficient binding of gp120 to the T-cell receptor CD4. Previous work had shown that an N-terminal amino acid tetrad LPCR and a Trp located 5-20 residues downstream to the tetrad are common motifs in polarity-driven switch peptides. The LPCR tetrad governs the folding of the subsequent residues and acts as a helix initiation site, whereas the Trp is responsible for the cooperative character of the structural change due to multiple, simultaneous interactions of its quadrupole moment with several amino acid residues within the sequences. Here we identify and characterize new families of switch peptides that use different, turn-probable tetrads (LPST and VPSR) as helix initiation sites at the N-terminus. We have also been able to demonstrate that some tetrads with extremely high turn probability do not serve as helix initiation sites. Comparison of these with LPCR and the newly discovered tetrads LPST and VPSR has allowed a more comprehensive description of the physico-chemical properties of helix-inducing tetrads. The deeper understanding of the intrinsic properties of switch sequences allows the design of artificial polarity-driven switches, applicable in engineering of, e.g. controllable binding sites in artificial proteins.

Here we describe the first extensive characterization of the refolding kinetics and conformational thermodynamics of reduced thioredoxin. We have previously described a genetic screen that yielded mutant thioredoxin proteins that fold more slowly in both the oxidized and reduced forms. In this study, we apply our more detailed analysis of reduced thioredoxin folding to a larger number of folding mutants that includes those obtained from continuation of the genetic screen. We have identified mutant proteins that display folding defects specifically in the reduced state but not the oxidized state. Some of these substitutions represent unusual folding mutants in that they result in semiconservative substitutions at solvent-exposed positions in the folded conformation and do not appear to affect the conformational stability of the protein. Further, the genetic selection yields mutants at only a limited number of sites, pointing to perhaps the most critical amino acids in the folding pathway and underscoring, in particular, the role of the carboxy-terminal amino acids in the folding of thioredoxin.

HGF is a heterodimeric protein containing 20 disulfide bonds distributed among an amino-terminal hairpin, four kringle domains, and a serine protease-like domain. Due to its complex structure, recombinant production of HGF in prokaryotes requires denaturation and refolding, processes that are impractical for large-scale manufacture. Thus, pharmaceutical quantities of HGF are not available despite its potential applications. A fragment of the Listeria monocytogenes internalin B protein from amino acids 36-321 (InlB(36-321)) was demonstrated to bind to and partially activate the HGF receptor Met. InlB(36-321) has a stable ÃŽÂ²-sheet structure and is easily produced in its native conformation by E. coli. We cloned InlB(36-321) (1ÃƒÂ—InlB(36-321)), and engineered a head-to-tail repeat of InlB(36-321) with a linker peptide (2ÃƒÂ—InlB(36-321)). 1ÃƒÂ—InlB(36-321) and 2ÃƒÂ—InlB(36-321) were purified from E. coli.

We subsequently compared signal transduction of the two proteins in primary lung endothelial cells. 2ÃƒÂ—InlB(36-321) activated ERK1/2, STAT3, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathways, whereas 1ÃƒÂ—InlB(36-321) activated only STAT3 and ERK1/2. 2ÃƒÂ—InlB(36-321) promoted improved motility compared with 1ÃƒÂ—InlB(36-321), and additionally stimulated proliferation equivalent to full length HGF. Both the 1ÃƒÂ— and 2ÃƒÂ—InlB(36-321) prevented apoptosis by the pro-fibrotic peptide angiotensin II in cell culture and ex vivo lung slice cultures. The ease of large scale production and capacity of 2ÃƒÂ—InlB(36-321) to mimic HGF make it a potential candidate as a pharmaceutical agent for tissue repair.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20889677 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Mungunsukh O, Lee YH, Marquez AP, Cecchi F, Bottaro DP, Day RM</author>\n    <category>Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20889677</guid>\n</item>	7	1287208794

As the recombinant OP1 (rhOP1) was shown to provide axonal guidance cues and to prevent the reduction of dendritic growth in the injury-induced cortical cultures, it was suggested that an in vivo efficient rhOP1 delivery could enhance neurite growth and functional reconnectivity in the damaged brain. In the present work, we engineered a chimeric molecule in which rhBMP7 was fused to a protein transduction domain derived from HIV-1 TAT protein to deliver the denatured recombinant BMP7 into cells and obtain its chaperone-mediated folding, circumventing the expensive and not much efficient in vitro refolding procedures. When tested on rat PC12 cells, a widely used in vitro neurogenic differentiation model, the resulting fusion protein (rhTAT-OP1) demonstrated to enter fastly into the cells, lose HIV-TAT sequence and interact with membrane receptors activating BMP pathway by SMAD 1/5/8 phosphorylation. In comparison with nerve growth factor (NGF) and BMP7, it proved itself effective to induce the formation of more organized H and M neurofilaments. Moreover, if used in combination with NGF, it stimulated a significant (P &lt; 0.05) and more precocious dendritic outgrowth with respect to NGF alone. These results indicate that rhTAT-OP1 fused with TAT trasduction domain shows neurogenic activity and may be a promising enhancer factor in NGF-based therapies.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20889531 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Di Liddo R, Grandi C, Venturini M, Dalzoppo D, Negro A, Conconi MT, Parnigotto PP</author>\n    <category>Protein Eng Des Sel</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20889531</guid>\n</item>	44	1287477300

Impairments in protein quality control (PQC) may lead to degenerative processes, such as aging and various disorders and diseases. Fortunately, cells contain a hierarchical system of pathways coping protein damage. Specific molecular pathways detect misfolded proteins and act either to unfold or degrade them. Degradation of proteins generates peptides and amino acids that can be used for remodelling of impaired pathways and cellular functions. At increased levels of cellular damage whole organelles can be removed via autophagy, a process that depends on the activity oflysosomes. In addition, cells may undergo apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death, which in single-cellular and lower multicellular organisms can lead to death of the individual. Molecular damage of cellular compartments is mainly caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS is generated via different cellular pathways and frequently arises in the mitochondrial electron transport chain as a by-product of oxygenic energy transduction. Consequently, mitochondrial proteins are under high risk to become damaged. Perhaps for this reason mitochondria contain a very efficient PQC system that keeps mitochondrial proteins functional as long as damage does not reach a certain threshold and the components of this system themselves are not excessively damaged. The mitochondrial PQC system consists of chaperones that counteract protein aggregation through binding and refolding misfolded polypeptides and of membrane-bound and soluble ATP-dependent proteases that are involved in degradation of damaged proteins. During aging and in neurodegenerative diseases components of this PQC system, including Lon protease present in the mitochondrial matrix, become functionally impaired. In this chapter we summarise the current knowledge of cellular quality control systems with special emphasis on the role of the mitochondrial PQC system and its impact on biological aging and disease.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20886760 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Luce K, Weil AC, Osiewacz HD</author>\n    <category>Adv Exp Med Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20886760</guid>\n</item>	12	1287477300

Maintenance of cellular homeostasis influences the rate of aging and its efficiency is determined by the cooperation between protein stability and resistance to stress, protein refolding, protein repair and proteolysis of damaged proteins. Protein degradation is predominately catalyzed by the proteasome which is responsible for cell clearance of abnormal, denatured or in general damaged proteins as well as for the regulated degradation of short-lived proteins. Impaired proteasome function has been tightly correlated to aging both in vivo and in vitro and thus, emphasis has been given recently in identifying ways of its activation. A number of studies have shown that the proteasome can be activated by genetic manipulations as well as by factors that affect either its conformation and stability or the expression of its subunits and the rate of proteasome assembly. This "readjustment" has been shown to have a great impact on retention of cellular homeostasis since it promotes lifespan extension. This chapter focuses on protein homeostasis and its direct link to proteasome function, dysfunction and manipulation and provides insights regarding the activation of proteasome-mediated protein degradation that, in turn, ensures health maintenance.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20886755 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Chondrogianni N, Gonos ES</author>\n    <category>Adv Exp Med Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20886755</guid>\n</item>	20	1287566147

While most in vitro studies of RNA rely on (re)folding chemically and/or enzymatically synthesized RNA in its entirety, which frequently leads into kinetic traps, nature reduces the complexity of the RNA folding problem by segmental, co-transcriptional folding starting from the 5' end. We here have developed a simplified, general, nondenaturing purification protocol for RNA to ask whether avoiding denaturation of a co-transcriptionally folded RNA can reduce commonly observed in vitro folding heterogeneity. Our protocol bypasses the need for large-scale auxiliary protein purification and expensive chromatographic equipment and involves rapid affinity capture with magnetic beads and removal of chemical heterogeneity by cleavage of the target RNA from the beads using the ligand-induced glmS ribozyme. For two disparate model systems, the Varkud satellite (VS) and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozymes, we achieve &gt;95% conformational purity within one hour of enzymatic transcription, without the need for any folding chaperones. We further demonstrate that in vitro refolding introduces severe conformational heterogeneity into the natively-purified VS ribozyme but not into the compact, double-nested pseudoknot fold of the HDV ribozyme. We conclude that conformational heterogeneity in complex RNAs can be avoided by co-transcriptional folding followed by nondenaturing purification, providing rapid access to chemically and conformationally pure RNA for biologically relevant biochemical and biophysical studies.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20886091 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Pereira MJ, Behera V, Walter NG</author>\n    <category>PLoS One</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20886091</guid>\n</item>	28	1287653403

In an attempt to characterize the amino acid residues responsible for the neurotoxic and anticoagulant activities of TmCT, the recombinant fusion proteins of TmCT wild type and mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli. Correct refolding and processing of 37 TmCT mutants were confirmed by their HPLC retention times, circular dichroism spectra, and masses obtained from ESI-MS spectrometry. Each mutant was assayed by pH-stat titration using zwitterionic as well as anionic micelle substrates, and the neurotoxicity was evaluated by using the contractile responses of chick biventer-cervicis muscles. The results demonstrated that the residues Asn(1), Asn(6), Lys(7), Ile(11), Met(12), Gly(53), Thr(79), His(108) and Met(118) are important to TmCT neurotoxicity. Through various tests, we also confirmed that enzymatic activity, as opposed to binding to Factor Xa, was a necessary part of TmCT's anticoagulant effect. In addition, pulldown assays of the WT and selected mutants revealed that TmCT's in vitro binding to crotoxin acidic subunit may involve a broad surface area. We conclude that the hot spot mutations at specific positions 53, 79, 108, and 118 during the pitviper Asn(6)-PLA(2) evolution regulate their neurotoxicities, and that many of the neurotoxic-site residues and the anticoagulant mechanism of TmCT are different from those of ammodytoxin A (a true-viper venom neurotoxic PLA(2)).</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20920547 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Tsai IH, Wang YM, Hseu MJ</author>\n    <category>Biochimie</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20920547</guid>\n</item>	0	1288065386

The results were compared with crystal structures and high- and low-temperature structures derived from molecular-dynamics calculations. The results of both experimental and computational methods indicate that the unfolding process starts with the loss of Î²-structures followed by the reversible loss of helix content from âˆ¼40% at 20Â°C to 27% at 70Â°C and âˆ¼20% at 77Â°C, beyond which unfolding becomes irreversible. Concomitantly there is a reversible increase in the radius of gyration of the protein from 15Â Ã… to 18 Ã…. The reversible decrease in forward x-ray scattering demonstrates a lack of aggregation upon unfolding, suggesting the change is due to a larger dilation of hydration water than of bulk water. Molecular-dynamics simulations suggest a similar sequence of events and are in good agreement with the (1)H(N) chemical shift differences in nuclear magnetic resonance. This study demonstrates the power of complementary methods for elucidating unfolding/refolding processes and the nature of both the unfolded structure, for which there is no crystallographic data, and the partially unfolded forms of the protein that can lead to fibril formation and disease.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20923660 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Meersman F, Atilgan C, Miles AJ, Bader R, Shang W, Matagne A, Wallace BA, Koch MH</author>\n    <category>Biophys J</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20923660</guid>\n</item>	33	1288164878

Ion-exchange refolding offers a relatively high degree of process intensification, represented by the possibility of performing protein refolding, product purification and product concentration, in one unit operation. Besides its high degree of process intensification, IExR offers an additional set of key advantages including: spatial isolation of the bound protein molecules and the controllable change in chemical composition using gradients. Despite of the acknowledgement of the former advantages, the lack of mechanistic understanding on how they influence the process performance of the ion-exchange refolding reactor, limits the ability to exploit them in order to optimize the performance of the unit. This paper presents a quantitative analysis that assesses the effect that the spatial isolation and the urea gradient, have on the IExR performance, judged on the basis of the refolding yield (Y(N)) and the fractional mass recovery (f(Prot,Rec)). Additionally, this work discusses the effect of the protein load, the protein loading state (i.e., native, denatured, denatured and reduced (D&amp;R)) and the adsorbent type on f(Prot,Rec). The presented work shows: (1) that the protein load has a direct effect on f(Prot,Rec), and the magnitude of this effect depends on the loading state of the protein solution and the adsorbent type; (2) that irrespectively of the type of adsorbent used, the saturation capacity of a denatured protein is less than the native protein and that this difference can be linked to differences in accessible binding surface area; (3) that there is a clear correlation between fractional surface coverage (Î¸) and f(Prot,Rec), indicating that the former could serve as a good descriptor to assess spatial isolation, and (4) that the urea gradient has a direct link with the variations on the refolding yield, and this link can be quantitatively estimated using as descriptor the urea gradient slope (Î¾). Overall, the information provided in this paper aims at the eventual development of rational design or selection strategies of ion-exchange media for the satisfactory and successful refolding of a target protein.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20933240 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Freydell EJ, van der Wielen L, Eppink M, Ottens M</author>\n    <category>J Chromatogr A</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20933240</guid>\n</item>	0	1288339900

Both proteins are HDL-associated apolipoproteins with similar anticipated biological functions. The structure of h-apoM has recently been determined by X-ray crystallography and revealed that h-apoM displays, as expected, a lipocalin-like fold characterized by an 8-stranded Î²â€‘barrel that encloses an internal fatty acid-binding site. Surprisingly, this is not true for mâ€‘apoM. After refolding from inclusion bodies, the crystal structure of m-apoM reported here at 2.5 Ã… resolution displays a novel yet unprecedented 7-stranded Î²-barrel structure. The fold difference is not caused by a mere deletion of a single Î²-strand; instead, Î²-strands E and F are removed and replaced by a single Î²-strand A' formed from residues from the Nâ€‘terminus. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that m-apoM is able to adopt both a 7â€‘stranded and an 8-stranded barrel structure in solution and that both folds are comparably stable. Thermal unfolding simulations identify the position where the Î²-strand exchange occurs as the weak point of the Î²-barrel. We wonder whether the switch in topology could have a biological function and facilitate ligand release since it goes in hand with a narrowing of the barrel diameter. Possibly also, the observed conformation represents an on-pathway or off-pathway folding intermediate of apoM. The difference in fold topology is quite remarkable, and the fold promiscuity observed for m-apoM might possibly provide a glimpse at potential crosspoints during the evolution of Î²-barrels.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20932978 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Sevvana M, Kassler K, Josefin A, Weiler S, DahlbÃ¤ck B, Sticht H, Muller YA</author>\n    <category>J Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20932978</guid>\n</item>	252	1288430019

The central event in disease development in TSEs is the refolding of the normal host-encoded cellular prion protein (PrP) into abnormal and disease associated prion protein. The agent is thought to consist mainly or exclusively of these pathologically folded PrP molecules. The exact molecular mechanisms underlying this process and the role of normal PrP in the conversion to pathological isoforms of PrP are still poorly understood. The highly conserved PrP gene structure and organisation however, suggests that its function is important, even though PrP knockout mice appear to develop normally. Conversion of normal PrP is initiated by interaction with abnormal PrP (or "agent") resulting in refolding of normal PrP into new pathological PrP ("agent replication"). Normal PrP was shown to interact/bind with many different molecules including metal ions, nucleic acids, several (receptor) proteins, and the prion protein itself. The processes underlying agent replication (normal to abnormal PrP conversion) are most likely initiated by selective interaction between PrP molecules and potentially influenced by chaperone molecules. Thus far no vaccine, disease reversing therapeutic compounds or strategies (cure) exists, although there are some compounds capable of slowing the progression of prion disease. Studies towards interference to date have primarily focussed on inference with the interaction between normal and pathological isoforms of PrP in order to develop therapeutic strategies or find compounds capable of inhibiting prion propagation. Most described strategies are either directed at depletion of normal PrP and thus preventing pathological PrP formation and accumulation, or are based on preventing interaction between normal and abnormal PrP. Other therapeutic strategies focus on selective (self-)interaction of normal PrP molecules. Increased understanding of these interactions and the processes in which normal PrP plays a (active) role, could potentially lead to new modes of inhibiting prion protein conversion in which the physiological function(s) of normal PrP is retained.

Despite numerous studies, the detailed molecular mechanism of defective enamel formation is still unknown. In this article, we have examined the biophysical properties of a recombinant murine amelogenin (rM180) and two point mutations identified from human DNA sequences in two cases of AI (T21I and P41T). At pH 5.8 and 25 Â°C, wild-type (WT) rM180 and mutant P41T existed as monomers whereas mutant T21I formed lower order oligomers. Circular dichroism (CD), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and fluorescence studies indicated that rM180 and P41T can be classified as a premolten globule-like subclass protein at 25 Â°C. Thermal denaturation and refolding monitored by CD ellipticity at 224 nm indicated the presence of a strong hysteresis in mutants compared to WT. Variable temperature tryptophan fluorescence and DLS studies showed that WT transformed to a partially folded conformation upon heating and remained stable. The partially folded conformation formed by P41T, however, readily converted into a heterogeneous population of aggregates. T21I existed in an oligomeric state at room temperature and upon heating, rapidly formed large aggregates over a very narrow temperature range. Thermal denaturation and refolding studies indicated that the mutants are less stable and exhibit poor refolding ability compared to WT rM180. Our results suggest that alterations in self-assembly of amelogenin are a consequence of destabilization of the intrinsic disorder. Therefore, we propose that, like a number of human diseases, AI appears to be due to the destabilization of the secondary structure as a result of amelogenin mutations.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20929860 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Laksminarayanan R, Bromley KM, Lei YP, Snead ML, Moradian-Oldak J</author>\n    <category>J Biol Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20929860</guid>\n</item>	0	1288843722

Urea is known as a common denaturing osmolyte that affects protein function by destabilizing their structure. On the other hand, it is known that the native conformation of proteins can be stabilized by protecting osmolytes which are found in the mammalian kidney. PC1 has an unusually long ectodomain with a multimodular structure including 16 Ig-like polycystic kidney disease (PKD) domains. Here we used single-molecule force spectroscopy to directly study the effects of several naturally occurring osmolytes on the mechanical properties of PKD domains. This experimental approach more closely mimics the conditions found in vivo. We show that upon increasing the concentration of urea there is a remarkable decrease in the mechanical stability of human PKD domains. We found that protecting osmolytes such as sorbitol and TMAO can counteract the denaturing effect of urea. Moreover, we found that the refolding rate of a structurally homologous archaeal PKD domain is significantly slowed down in urea, and this effect was counteracted by sorbitol. Our results demonstrate that naturally occurring osmolytes can have profound effects on the mechanical unfolding and refolding pathways of PKD domains. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that osmolytes such as urea or sorbitol may modulate PC1 mechanical properties and may lead to changes in the activation of the associated Polycystin-2 channel or other intracellular events mediated by PC1.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20937836 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Ma L, Xu M, Oberhauser AF</author>\n    <category>J Biol Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20937836</guid>\n</item>	0	1289375731

It is a regulated process in cells from bacteria to humans, leading to the deposition of aggregates at specific sites. The sequestration of misfolded proteins in such a way is protective for cell function as it allows for their efficient solubilization and refolding or degradation by components of the protein quality-control network.

The presence of intracellular protein aggregates, known as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, within the surviving nigral neurons is the defining neuropathological feature of the disease. Accordingly, the identification of specific genes mutated in families with Parkinson's disease and of genetic susceptibility variants for idiopathic Parkinson's disease has implicated abnormalities in proteostasis, or the handling and elimination of misfolded proteins, in the pathogenesis of this neurodegenerative disorder. Protein folding and the refolding of misfolded proteins are regulated by a network of interactive molecules, known as the chaperone system, which is composed of molecular chaperones and co-chaperones. The chaperone system is intimately associated with the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the autophagy-lysosomal pathway which are responsible for elimination of misfolded proteins and protein quality control. In addition to their role in proteostasis, some chaperone molecules are involved in the regulation of cell death pathways. Here we review the role of the molecular chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp90, and the cochaperones Hsp40, BAG family members such as BAG5, CHIP and Hip in modulating neuronal death with a focus on dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. We also review current progress in preclinical studies aimed at targetting the chaperone system to prevent neurodegeneration. Finally, we discuss potential future chaperone-based therapeutics for the symptomatic treatment and possible disease modification of Parkinson's disease.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20942788 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Kalia SK, Kalia LV, McLean PJ</author>\n    <category>CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20942788</guid>\n</item>	0	1290147991

This resulted in a toltrazuril-binding clone expressing the surface peptide YNVREDIRPVMD, which fitted best with a cDNA encoding a hypothetical 20.5kDa ABH-like cyclophilin in E. tenella. After cloning the corresponding gene from E. tenella, we recombinantly expressed the cyclophilin EtCyp21, which was enzymatically active with k(cat)/K(m)=8Î¼M(-1)s(-1) as determined by peptidyl-prolyl-cis/trans-isomerase (PPIase) assay and RNase T1 refolding assay. The common cyclophilin inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) inhibited PPIase activity (IC(50)=6.3nM) as well as RNase T1 refolding activity. In contrast to CsA, toltrazuril did not completely suppress the PPIase activity of EtCyp21 and its IC(50) (1.84Î¼M) was much higher.

Here we describe a stable, misfolded luciferase species that can be efficiently renatured by substoichiometric amounts of bacterial Hsp70-Hsp40-NEF. The reactivation rates increased with substrate concentration and followed saturation kinetics, thus allowing the determination of apparent V(max)' and K(m)' values for a chaperone-mediated renaturation reaction for the first time. Under the in vitro conditions used, one Hsp70 molecule consumed five ATPs to effectively unfold a single misfolded protein into an intermediate that, upon chaperone dissociation, spontaneously refolded to the native state, a process with an ATP cost a thousand times lower than expected for protein degradation and resynthesis.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20953191 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Sharma SK, De Los Rios P, Christen P, Lustig A, Goloubinoff P</author>\n    <category>Nat Chem Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20953191</guid>\n</item>	2	1290744571

Using shear-aligned lipid vesicles conformations and binding geometries of membrane-bound bio-macromolecules can be assessed. Here we investigate anchoring properties and specific orientations of tryptophan relative to the peptide backbone and to the membrane normal for the model peptides gramicidin and melittin. We have monitored the conformational change associated with the refolding of non-channel gramicidin into its channel form, and quantitatively determined the average orientations of its tryptophan transition moments, suggesting that these residues adopt a well-defined orientation at the membrane interface. An important conclusion regards the structural variation of gramicidin between these two distinct transmembrane forms. Whilst circular dichroism (CD) spectra, as has been reported before, vary strongly between the two forms suggesting their structures might be quite different, the LD results clearly evidences both the peptide backbone orientation and tryptophan side-chain positioning to be very similar. The latter are oriented in accordance with what is expected from their role to anchor peptide termini to the membrane surface. The variations in CD could be due to, the in LD observed, minor shifts in mutual orientation and distance between neighbouring tryptophans sensitively determining their exciton interactions. Our data disputes that the non-channel form of membrane-bound gramicidin would be any of the intertwined forms often observed in crystal as their positioning of tryptophans along the peptide axis is not compatible with the strong interfacial positioning observed here. The general role of tryptophans as interfacial anchors is further assessed for melittin whose conformation shows considerable angular spread, consistent with a carpet model of its mechanism for induced membrane leakage, and a predominantly surface-aligned membrane orientation governed by amphipathic interactions.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20951675 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Svensson FR, Lincoln P, NordÃ©n B, EsbjÃ¶rner EK</author>\n    <category>Biochim Biophys Acta</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20951675</guid>\n</item>	1	1290744571

FlFFF is a liquid-phase separation technique that can separate macromolecules and particles according to size. The technique is increasingly used on a routine basis in a variety of application fields. In food analysis, FlFFF is applied to determine the molecular size distribution of starches and modified celluloses, or to study protein aggregation during food processing. In industrial analysis, it is applied for the characterization of polysaccharides that are used as thickeners and dispersing agents. In pharmaceutical and biomedical laboratories, FlFFF is used to monitor the refolding of recombinant proteins, to detect aggregates of antibodies, or to determine the size distribution of drug carrier particles. In environmental studies, FlFFF is used to characterize natural colloids in water streams, and especially to study trace metal distributions over colloidal particles. In this review, first a short discussion of the state of the art in instrumentation is given. Developments in the coupling of FlFFF to various detection modes are then highlighted. Finally, application studies are discussed and ordered according to the type of (bio) macromolecules or bioparticles that are fractionated.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20957473 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Qureshi RN, Kok WT</author>\n    <category>Anal Bioanal Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20957473</guid>\n</item>	0	1290744571

An improved understanding of the physics and chemistry underlying the device properties and the recognition process is necessary for performance optimization. This is especially important for the recognition and immobilization of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), like the prion protein (PrP), a partial IDP, whose folding and stability may be influenced by local environment and confinement. Atomic force microscopy allows for both highly controllable nanolithography and for sensitive and accurate direct detection, via precise topographic measurements on ultraflat surfaces, of protein interactions in a liquid environment, thus different environmental parameters affecting the biorecognition phenomenon can be investigated in situ. Using nanografting, a tip-induced lithographic technique, and an affinity immobilization strategy based on two different histidine tagged antibodies, with high nM affinity for two different regions of PrP, we successfully demonstrated the immobilization of recombinant mouse PrP onto nanostructured surfaces, in two different orientations. Clear discrimination of the two molecular orientations was shown by differential height (i.e., topographic) measurements, allowing for the estimation of binding parameters and the full characterization of the nanoscale biorecognition process. Our work opens the way to several high sensitivity diagnostic applications and, by controlling PrP orientation, allows for the investigation of unconventional interactions with partially folded proteins, and may serve as a platform for protein misfolding and refolding studies on PrP and other thermodynamically unstable, fibril forming, proteins.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20958083 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Sanavio B, Scaini D, Grunwald C, Legname G, Scoles G, Casalis L</author>\n    <category>ACS Nano</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20958083</guid>\n</item>	5	1290744571

The Hly translocator complex exports a variety of passenger proteins when fused N-terminal to this secretion sequence. However, not all fusions are secreted efficiently. Here, we demonstrate that the maltose binding protein (MalE) lacking its natural export signal and fused to the HlyA secretion signal is poorly secreted by the Hly system. Anticipating that folding kinetics might be limiting, we introduced the folding mutation Y283D into MalE and indeed the fusion protein was now secreted at a much higher level. This level was further enhanced by the introduction of a second MalE folding mutation (V8G or A276G). Secretion did not require the molecular chaperone SecB. Folding analysis revealed that all mutations reduced the refolding rate of the substrate, whereas the unfolding rate was unaffected. Thus, the efficiency of secretion by the Hly system is dictated by the folding rate of the substrate. Moreover, we demonstrate that fusion proteins defective in export can be engineered for secretion while still retaining function.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20971850 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Bakkes PJ, Jenewein S, Smits SH, Holland IB, Schmitt L</author>\n    <category>J Biol Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20971850</guid>\n</item>	42	1291363185

Its protein stability is regulated by ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, mainly mediated by Mdm2. However, other E3 ligases have been identified, like the chaperone-associated ligase CHIP, albeit their precise function regarding p53 degradation remains elusive. Interestingly, CHIP deficiency has been recently shown to result in accelerated aging in mice, although the molecular basis of this phenotype was not completely understood. In this study, we explore the role of CHIP in regulating p53 in senescence. We demonstrate that in senescent human fibroblasts, CHIP is up-regulated concomitant with a significant down-regulation of p53. Moreover, CHIP partially translocates to the nucleus and acquires higher ubiquitination levels in senescent cells. Notably, CHIP overexpression in young cells, to levels similar to those recorded during senescence, leads to p53 degradation bellow its basal levels. In addition, while CHIP silencing has no effect on p53 stability in young cells, a considerable p53 accumulation occurs in their senescent counterparts. Finally, we have observed an attenuation of the CHIP-associated molecular folding-refolding machinery during senescence and supportively, inhibition of Hsp90 activity leads to p53 rapid degradation only in senescent cells. Taken together, we conclude that CHIP-dependent p53 regulation occurs specifically during senescence.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20974249 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Sisoula C, Trachana V, Patterson C, Gonos ES</author>\n    <category>Free Radic Biol Med</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20974249</guid>\n</item>	9	1291363185

The Archeal chaperonin from Methanococcus marapaludis, Mm-Cpn, shares the eight-fold double barrel structure with other Group II chaperonins, including the eukaryotic TRiC/CCT, required for actin and tubulin folding. However, Mm-Cpn is composed of a single species subunit, similar to Group I chaperonin GroEL, rather than the eight subunit species needed for TRiC/CCT. Features of the Î²-sheet fold have been identified as sites of recognition by Group II chaperonins. The crystallins, the major components of the vertebrate eye lens, are Î²-sheet proteins with two homologous Greek key domains. During refolding in vitro a partially folded intermediate is populated, and partitions between productive folding and off-pathway aggregation. We report here that in the presence of physiological concentrations of ATP, Mm-Cpn suppressed the aggregation of HÎ³D-Crys by binding the partially folded intermediate. The complex was sufficiently stable to permit recovery by size exclusion chromatography. In the presence of ATP, Mm-Cpn promoted the refolding of the HÎ³D-Crys intermediates to the native state. The ability of Mm-Cpn to bind and refold a human Î²-sheet protein, suggests that Mm-Cpn may be useful as a simplified model for the substrate recognition mechanism of TRiC/CCT.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 20981710 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Knee KM, Goulet DR, Zhang J, Chen B, Chiu W, King JA</author>\n    <category>Protein Sci</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:20981710</guid>\n</item>	77	1291717589

H. pylori cysteine-rich protein B (HcpB) is a disulfide-rich repeat protein that belongs to the family of Sel1-like repeat proteins. HcpB contains four pairs of anti-parallel alpha helices that fold into four repeats with disulfide bonds bridging the helices of each repeat. Recent in vitro oxidative refolding of HcpB identified that the formation and folding of the disulfide bond in the N-terminal repeat are the rate limiting step. Here we attempted to understand the disulfide formation of HcpB in the periplasm of Escherichia coli. The protein was expressed in wild type (possessed enzymes DsbA, B, C, and D) and knock out (Dsb enzymes deleted one at a time) E. coli strains. The soluble part of the periplasm when analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western Blot showed that the wild type and DsbC/D knock out strains contained native oxidized HcpB while the protein was absent in the DsbA/B knock out strains. Hence the recombinant expression of HcpB in E. coli requires DsbA and DsbB for disulfide bond formation and it is independent of DsbC and DsbD. Prolonged cell growth resulted in the proteolytic degradation of the N-terminal repeat of HcpB. The delayed folding of the N-terminal repeat observed during in vitro oxidative refolding could be the reason for the enhanced susceptibility to proteolytic cleavage in the periplasm. In summary, a good correlation between in vivo and in vitro disulfide bond formation of HcpB is observed.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21046390 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Devi VS, Mittl PR</author>\n    <category>Curr Microbiol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21046390</guid>\n</item>	2	1292383685

However, little effort has been allocated to the development of mechanistic models describing size-exclusion chromatographic refolding reactors (SECRR). Mechanistic models are important since they provide a link between process variables like denatured and reduced protein feed concentration (C(f,D&amp;R)), flow rate, column length, etc., and performance indicators like refolding yield (Y(N)), thereby opening the possibility for in silico design of SECRRs. A critical step, in the formulation of such models, is the selection of an adequate reaction mechanism, which provides the direct link between the separation and the refolding yield. Therefore, in this work we present a methodology using a SEC refolding reactor model, supported by a library of reaction mechanisms, to estimate a suitable reaction scheme using experimental SEC refolding data. SEC refolding data is used since it provides information about the mass distribution of monomers and aggregates after refolding, information not readily available from batch dilution refolding data alone. Additionally, this work presents (1) a systematic analysis of the reaction mechanisms considered using characteristic time analysis and DamkÃ¶hler maps, revealing (a) the direct effect of a given reaction mechanism on the shape of the SEC refolding chromatogram (number of peaks and resolution) and (b) the effect that the competition between convection, refolding and aggregation is likely to have on the SEC refolding yield; (2) a comparison between the SECR reactor and the batch dilution refolding reactor based on mechanistic modeling, quantitatively showing the advantages of the former over the latter; and (3) the successful application of the modeling based strategy to study the SEC refolding data of an industrially relevant protein. In principle, the presented modeling strategy can be applied to any protein refolded using any gel filtration material, providing the proper mass balances and activity measurements are available.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21055758 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Freydell EJ, van der Wielen LA, Eppink MH, Ottens M</author>\n    <category>J Chromatogr A</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21055758</guid>\n</item>	0	1292383685

Chitin, beta-1,4 linked GlcNAc homopolymer, is an essential component of filamentous fungi cell wall. Chitin synthase, processive membranous protein, has been recognized as a promising target for new antifungicides. Enzymatic characterizations of chitin synthases have been limited, mainly because purity and amounts of integral enzyme obtained after purification procedures are not sufficient. FINDINGS: We undertook the preparation of two BcCHS3 fragment proteins, containing only central SGC domain and devoided of N-terminal and transmembrane C-terminal regions. The central domain of CHS3 named SGC (Spsa GntI Core) is conserved in all UDP-glycosyltransferases and it should contain the active site of the enzyme. CHS3a-SGC protein was totally expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. We performed recombinant CHS3a-SGC purification in denaturated conditions, followed by a refolding step. Although circular dichroism spectra clearly exhibited secondary structures of renaturated CHS3a-SGC, no chitin synthase activity was detected. Nevertheless CHS3a-SGC proteins show a specific binding for the substrate UDP-GlcNAc with a Kd constant similar to the Km value and a major contribution of the uracil moiety for recognition was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that CHS3a-SGC protein could be easily obtained on a mg-scale with native-like properties such as specific substrate UDP-GlcNAc binding. These results are encouraging for the next heterologous expression of full-length CHS3a.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21070667 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Magellan H, Drujon T, Thellend A, Piffeteau A, Becker HF</author>\n    <category>BMC Res Notes</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21070667</guid>\n</item>	5	1292483748

We have developed bacterial systems for expression and purification of properly folded functional hemagglutinin as a rapid response to emerging pandemic strains. A recombinant H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) hemagglutinin globular domain (HA1), was produced in E coli under controlled redox refolding conditions. Importantly, the properly folded HA1 (1-320) contained â‰¥ 75% functional oligomers without addition of foreign oligomerization sequence. Site directed mutagenesis mapped the oligomerization signal to the HA1 N-terminal Ile-Cys-Ile residues at positions 3-5. The purified HA1 oligomers (but not monomers) bound fetuin and agglutinated red blood cells. Upon immunization of rabbits, the oligomeric HA1 (1-320) elicited potent neutralizing antibodies against homologous and heterologous H5N1 viruses more rapidly than HA1 (28-320) containing only monomers. Ferrets vaccinated with oligomeric HA1 (but not N-terminus-deleted, monomeric HA1) at 15 and 3 Î¼g/dose were fully protected from lethality and weight loss following challenge with homologous (H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004, clade 1) as well as heterologous clade 2.2 H5N1 (A/WooperSwan/Mongolia/244/2005) virus. Protection was associated with a significant reduction in viral loads in the nasal washes of homologous and heterologous virus challenged ferrets. This is the first study that describes the presence of an N-terminal oligomerization sequence in the globular domain of influenza hemagglutinin. Our findings suggest that functional oligomeric rHA1-based vaccines can be produced efficiently in bacterial systems and can be easily upscaled in response to a pandemic influenza threat.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21084473 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Khurana S, Verma S, Verma N, Crevar CJ, Carter DM, Manischewitz J, King LR, Ross TM, Golding H</author>\n    <category>J Virol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21084473</guid>\n</item>	4	1292917432

Recombinant human enteropeptidase light chain (hEPL) shows high activity but low solubility and refolding yields, currently limiting its use in biotechnological applications. Here we describe several protein modifications that lead to improved solubility and refolding yield of human hEPL whilst retaining the enzyme activity. Specifically, protein surface supercharging (N6D, G21D, G22D, N141D, K209E) of the protein increased the solubility more than 100-fold. Replacement of a free cysteine residue with serine (C112S) improved the refolding yield by 50%. The heat stability of this C112S variant was also significantly improved by supercharging.

Although the recombinant Î”E155 enzyme expressed in E. coli is active, the deletion causes a deficiency of the active enzyme in vivo. The crystal structure and the folding/unfolding kinetics of the Î”E155 variant were determined in order to investigate the cause of the rapid loss of the enzyme in human cells. The crystal structure revealed altered packing around the E155 deletion, an increase in the predicted solvent accessible area and a corresponding reduction in the buried surface area. This increase in solvent accessibility was consistent with an elevated Stern-Volmer constant. The unfolding of both the wild type and Î”E155 enzyme in urea is best described by a three state model, and there is evidence for the more pronounced population of an intermediate state by the Î”E155 enzymes. Studies using intrinsic fluorescence revealed a free energy change around 14.4 kcal/mol for the wild type compared with around 8.6 kcal/mol for the Î”E155 variant, which indicated a decrease in stability associated the with E155 deletion. Urea induced unfolding of the wild type GSTO1-1 was reversible through an initial fast phase followed by a second slow phase. In contrast the Î”E155 variant lacks the slow phase, indicating a refolding defect. It is possible that in some conditions in vivo, the increased solvent accessible area and the low stability of the Î”E155 variant may promote its unfolding while the refolding defect limits its refolding, resulting in GSTO1-1 deficiency.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21106529 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Zhou H, Brock J, Casarotto MG, Oakley AJ, Board PG</author>\n    <category>J Biol Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21106529</guid>\n</item>	92	1293007961

NNRTIs bind in a hydrophobic pocket located in the p66 subunit of reverse transcriptase (RT), which is not present in crystal structures of RT without an inhibitor. Recent studies showed that monomeric forms of the p66 and p51 subunits bind efavirenz with micromolar affinity. The effect of efavirenz on the solution conformations of p66 and p51 monomers was studied by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HXMS) and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). HXMS data reveal that five peptides, four of which contain efavirenz contact residues seen in the crystal structure of the RT-EFV complex, exhibit a reduced level of exchange in monomer-EFV complexes. Moreover, peptide 232-246 undergoes slow cooperative unfolding-refolding in the bound monomers, but at a rate much slower than that observed in the p66 subunit of the RT heterodimer [Seckler, J. M., Howard, K. J., Barkley, M. D., and Wintrode, P. L. (2009) Biochemistry 48, 7646-7655]. These results suggest that the efavirenz binding site on p66 and p51 monomers is similar to the NNRTI binding pocket in the p66 subunit of RT. Nanoelectrospray ionization FT-ICR mass spectra indicate that the intact monomers each have (at least) two different conformations. In the presence of efavirenz, the mass spectra change significantly and suggest that p51 adopts a single, more compact conformation, whereas p66 undergoes facile, electrospray-induced cleavage. The population shift is consistent with a selected-fit binding mechanism.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21090588 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Braz VA, Barkley MD, Jockusch RA, Wintrode PL</author>\n    <category>Biochemistry</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21090588</guid>\n</item>	3	1293536165

Thus, a dual-gradient of urea and pH on the anion-exchange chromatography resulted in remarkable increase of specific fibrinolytic and anti-coagulative activities of the refolded protein.

Thus, understanding the transient properties and dimensions of such peptides under folding conditions is a necessary step in the understanding of their subsequent folding behavior. Such ensembles can also undergo alternative folding, and form amyloid structures which are involved in many neurological degenerative diseases. Here, we performed a structural study of this initial state using time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis of a series of eight partially overlapping double labeled chain segments of the N terminal and NAC domains of the alpha synuclein molecule (Î±S). The distributions of end to end distance and segmental intramolecular diffusion coefficient were simultaneously determined for eight labeled chain segments. We used the coefficient of variation, C(v), as a measure of the conformational heterogeneity, i.e. structural disorder. With the exception of two segments, the C(v)s were characteristic of a fully disordered state of the chain. Subtle deviations from this behavior at the segment labeled in the NAC domain and the segment at the N-termini reflected subtle conformational bias that might be related to the initiation of transition to amyloid aggregates. The chain length dependence of the mean segmental end to end distance followed a power law as predicted by Flory, but the dependence was steeper than previously predicted, probably due to the contribution of the excluded volume effect, which is more dominant for shorter chain segments. The observed intramolecular diffusion coefficients (&lt;10 to ~25 Çº(2)/ns) are only an order of magnitude lower than the common diffusion coefficients of low molecular weight probes.

Therefore, both overexpression of the molecular folding machinery and induced accumulation of chemical chaperones are options to improve the correct folding of recombinantly expressed proteins. These two parameters may show synergistic effects, although success remains protein specific and, therefore, several combinations of molecular and chemical chaperones should be compared. However, proteins can fail to fold correctly even in optimized culture conditions. In this case, protein aggregates can be recovered and their refolding assisted by an osmolyte/chaperone-dependent system. The selection of aggregates with different degrees of complexity can be exploited to maximize the yields of native proteins at the end of the refolding process.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21125379 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> de Marco A</author>\n    <category>Methods Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21125379</guid>\n</item>	2	1293771781

The discrepancy arises because mechanical protein refolding studies are more technically challenging. RESULTS: We developed software that can drive and analyse mechanical refolding experiments when used with the commercial AFM setup "Picoforce AFM", Bruker (previously Digital Instruments). We expect the software to be easily adaptable to other AFM setups. We also developed an improved method for the statistical characterisation of protein folding kinetics, and implemented it into an AFM-independent software module.

In the present study, the coding sequence of the mature form of A. baumannii OmpA was cloned into the vector pET-15b and purified under denaturing conditions from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies using nickel affinity chromatography. A Triton X-114 wash step was incorporated into the purification method in order to remove endotoxin, resulting in endotoxin levels of &lt; 1.3 EU/mg of protein. A protocol was developed for refolding the purified protein by dilution into the non-ionic detergent n-octyl Î²-D glucopyranoside followed by dialysis to remove excess denaturant and detergent. Cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that refolded A. baumannii OmpA was able to induce cell death in A549 cells. In addition, a polyclonal antibody was raised against the refolded protein and used to assess extracellular secretion of OmpA by Western blot.

We have therefore explored the stability and activity of Î±-chymotrypsin (CT) in the presence of five ILs from different families, such as triethyl ammonium acetate (TEAA), triethyl ammonium phosphate (TEAP) from ammonium salts, 1-benzyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Bzmim][Cl]), 1-benzyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([Bzmim][BF(4)]) from imidazolium salts and tetra-butyl phosphonium bromide (TBPBr) from phosphonium families. Circular dichroism (CD) and UV-vis spectrophotometer experiments were used to study CT stabilization by ILs, related to the associated structural changes and enzyme activity studies, respectively. We observed that all ILs have a dominant contribution to the stabilization of CT. The stability and activity of CT depends on the structural arrangement of the ions of ILs. Our experimental results explicitly elucidate that more hydrophobic imidazolium and phosphonium cations carrying longer alkyl chains of ILs ([Bzmim][Cl], [Bzmim][BF(4)] and TBPBr) were weak stabilizers for CT, while small alkyl chain molecules of triethyl ammonium salts (TEAA and TEAP) are strong stabilizers and therefore more biocompatible for CT stability.

Its structure and the mechanism by which it protects its target protein from aggregating and precipitating are not known. METHODS: Dynamic light scattering and X-ray solution scattering techniques were used to investigate structural features of the Î±B-crystallin oligomer when complexed with target proteins under mild stress conditions, i.e., reduction of Î±-lactalbumin at 37Â Â°C and malate dehydrogenase when heated at 42Â Â°C. In this investigation, the size, shape and particle distribution of the complexes were determined in real-time following the induction of stress. RESULTS: Overall, it is observed that the mass distribution, hydrodynamic radius, and spherical shape of the Î±B-crystallin oligomer do not alter significantly when it complexes with its target protein. CONCLUSIONS: The data are consistent with the target protein being located in the outer protein shell of the Î±B-crystallin oligomer where it is readily accessible for possible refolding via the action of other molecular chaperones.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21152271 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Regini JW, Ecroyd H, Meehan S, Bremmell K, Clarke MJ, Lammie D, Wess T, Carver JA</author>\n    <category>Mol Vis</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21152271</guid>\n</item>	23	1294284053

Killing depends on the periplasmic peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase)/chaperone FkpA. To identify the Cma prolyl bonds targeted by FkpA, we replaced the 15 proline residues individually with alanine. Nine mutant proteins were fully active; Cma(P129A), Cma(P176A), and Cma(P260A) displayed 1% and Cma(P107A) 10% of the wild-type activity. Cma(P107A), Cma(P129A), and Cma(P260A) but not Cma(P176A) killed cells after entering the periplasm via osmotic shock, indicating that the former mutants were translocation deficient; Cma(P129A) did not bind to the FhuA outer membrane receptor. The crystal structures of Cma and Cma(P176A) were identical, excluding inactivation of the activity domain located far from P176. In a new PPIase assay, FkpA isomerized the Cma prolyl bond in peptide FP(176) at a high rate but KP(107) and LP(260) at only &lt;10% of that rate. The four mutant proteins secreted into the periplasm via a fused signal sequence were toxic but much less than wild-type Cma. Wild-type and mutant Cma proteins secreted or translocated across the outer membrane by energy-coupled import or unspecific osmotic shock were only active in the presence of FkpA. We propose that Cma unfolds during transfer across the outer or cytoplasmic membrane and refolds to the active form in the periplasm assisted by FkpA. Weak refolding of Cma(P176A) would explain its low activity in all assays. Of the four proline residues identified as being important for Cma activity, FP(176) is most likely targeted by FkpA.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21149455 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Helbig S, Patzer SI, Schiene-Fischer C, Zeth K, Braun V</author>\n    <category>J Biol Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21149455</guid>\n</item>	3	1294463991

After purifying and refolding the recombinant LURE2 with a poly-histidine tag, its amino groups were targeted for conjugation with the Alexa Fluor dye. Labeling of LURE2 was confirmed by its fluorescence and mass spectrometry. In our in vitro assay using gelatin beads, Alexa Fluor 488-labeled LURE2 appeared to have the same activity as unlabeled LURE2. Using the labeled LURE2, the relationship between the spatiotemporal change of distribution and activity of LURE2 was examined. LURE2 attracted pollen tubes when embedded in gelatin beads, but hardly in agarose beads. Direct visualization suggested that the significant difference between these conditions was the retention of LURE2 in the gelatin bead, which might keep diffusion of LURE2 from the bead.

Here we investigated how the two domains and their interplay are optimized for the function in protein folding. Unfolded protein molecules initially form a highly dynamic complex with the chaperone domain of SlyD, and then they are transferred to the prolyl isomerase domain. The turnover number of the prolyl isomerase site is very high and guarantees that, after transfer, prolyl peptide bonds in the substrate proteins are isomerized very rapidly. The Michaelis constant of catalyzed folding reflects the substrate affinity of the chaperone domain, the turnover number is presumably determined by the rate of productive substrate transfer from the chaperone to the prolyl isomerase site and by the intrinsic propensity of the refolding protein chain to leave the active site with the native prolyl isomer. The efficiency of substrate transfer is high because dissociation from the chaperone site is very fast and because the two sites are close to each other. Protein molecules that left the prolyl isomerase site with an incorrect prolyl isomer can rapidly be re-bound by the chaperone domain, because the association rate is very high as well.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21147124 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> ZoldÃ¡k G, Schmid FX</author>\n    <category>J Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21147124</guid>\n</item>	5	1294460797

A buffer containing caseins exhibited higher refolding activity for denatured bovine carbonic anhydrase than buffers including other proteins. In particular, a buffer containing Î±-casein showed about a two-fold higher refolding activity compared with absence of Î±-casein.

We expressed the RNase in live cells and analyzed its folding, quality control, and secretion using pulse-chase analysis and other cell biological techniques. In contrast to the slow in vitro refolding, the protein folded almost instantly after translation and translocation into the ER lumen (T1/2 &lt; 3 min). Despite high stability of the native protein, only about half of the RNase reached a secretion-competent, monomeric form and was rapidly transported from the rough ER via the Golgi complex (T1/2 = 16 min) to the extracellular space (T1/2 = 35 min). The rest remained in the ER mainly in the form of dimers, and was slowly degraded. The dimers were most likely formed by C-terminal domain swapping since mutation of Asn113, a residue that stabilizes such dimers, to Ser increased the efficiency of secretion from 59% to 75%. Consistent with stringent ER quality control in vivo, the secreted RNase in the bovine pancreas was mainly monomeric whereas the enzyme present in the cells also contained 20% dimers. These results suggest that the efficiency of secretion is not only determined by the stability of the native protein but by multiple factors including the stability of secretion-incompetent side products of folding. The presence of N-glycans had little effect on the folding and secretion process.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21156800 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Geiger R, Gautschi M, Thor F, Hayer A, Helenius A</author>\n    <category>J Biol Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21156800</guid>\n</item>	19	1294460489

Using a chemical library composed of 90 sulphonated molecules and a novel MS screening approach, we initially single out a few new binders. To check for anti-amyloid activity, the best hit obtained was thoroughly studied by docking analysis, affinity and refolding experiments by capillary electrophoresis and in vitro fibrillogenesis Thioflavin T test. Correlative analysis of the overall results obtained from the MS screening led to develop an equation able to identify the key factors of the affinity for Î²(2)-microglobulin and to predict the affinity for novel derivatives. The proposed equation was then used for a virtual screening of a large compound database. Studies on the new hit thus retrieved confirm the predictive potential of both the equation on affinity and of docking analysis on anti-amyloid activity.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21168564 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Regazzoni L, Colombo R, Bertoletti L, Vistoli G, Aldini G, Serra M, Carini M, Facino RM, Giorgetti S, Stoppini M, Caccialanza G, De Lorenzi E</author>\n    <category>Anal Chim Acta</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21168564</guid>\n</item>	0	1294542761

In fact especially their extraction from the respective membrane is difficult and often goes along with losses in yield. Usually expensive detergents are needed to extract the target protein from the membrane. Therefore finding an efficient overexpression and extraction method and an alternative to detergents is desirable. In this study we describe a new and fast method to express, extract and purify an engineered variant of the FhuA protein (FhuA Î”1-159) that acts as passive diffusion channel, using a diblock copolymer as an alternative to detergents like octyl-POE (n-Octylpolyoxyethylene). The N-terminal leader sequence, facilitating the protein's transport to the outer membrane was deleted (FhuA Î”1-159 Î”signal), resulting in protein accumulation in easy to isolate inclusion bodies. Urea was used to solubilise the unfolded protein and dialysis against phosphate-buffer containing the commercially available diblock copolymer PE-PEG [Polyethylene-Poly(ethyleneglycol)] lead to protein refolding. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed a high Î²-sheet percentage within the refolded protein secondary structure indicating the successful reconstitution of FhuA Î”1-159 Î”signal native state. Furthermore the channel functionality of FhuA Î”1-159 Î”signal was verified by measuring the in and out-flux through the protein when inserted into liposome membrane, using the HRP/TMB (HRP = Horse Radish Peroxidase, TMB = 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine) assay system.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21168506 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Dworeck T, Petri AK, Muhammad N, Fioroni M, Schwaneberg U</author>\n    <category>Protein Expr Purif</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21168506</guid>\n</item>	3	1294617894

The target proteins were genetically fused to a self-cleaving chitin-binding domain-intein tag for purification via a chitin-agarose affinity resin. By attaching the intein-tagged fusion genes to the PelB secretion leader sequence, the tagged target proteins were secreted to the periplasmic space and could be recovered in active form by simple osmotic shock. After chitin-affinity purification, the target proteins were released from the chitin-binding domain tag via intein self-cleaving. This was induced by a small change in pH from 8.5 to 6.5 at room temperature, allowing direct elution of the cleaved target protein from the chitin affinity resin. The target proteins include the E. coli maltose binding protein and Î²-lactamase enzyme, as well as two human antibody fragments that contain disulfide bonds. In all cases, the target proteins were purified with good activity and yield, without the need for refolding.

It binds both major histocompatibility class II (MHCII) and HSC70/Hsp73 molecules. P140 peptide increases MRL/lpr peripheral blood lymphocyte apoptosis and decreases autoepitope recognition by T cells. OBJECTIVE: /st&gt; To explore further the mode of action of P140 peptide on HSC70+ antigen-presenting cells. METHODS: /st&gt; P140 biodistribution was monitored in real time using an imaging system and by fluorescence and electron microscopy. Fluorescence activated cell sorting and Western blotting experiments were used to evaluate the P140 effects on autophagic flux markers. RESULTS: /st&gt; P140 fluorescence accumulated especially in the lungs and spleen. P140 peptide reduced the number of peripheral and splenic T and B cells without affecting these cells in normal mice. Remaining MRL/lpr B cells responded normally to mitogens. P140 peptide decreased the expression levels of HSC70/Hsp73 chaperone and stable MHCII dimers, which are both increased in MRL/lpr splenic B cells. It impaired refolding properties of chaperone HSC70. In MRL/lpr B cells, it increased the accumulation of the autophagy markers p62/SQSTM1 and LC3-II, consistent with a downregulated lysosomal degradation during autophagic flux. CONCLUSION: /st&gt; The study results suggest that after P140 peptide binding to HSC70, the endogenous (auto)antigen processing might be greatly affected in MRL/lpr antigen-presenting B cells, leading to the observed decrease of autoreactive T-cell priming and signalling via a mechanism involving a lysosomal degradation pathway. This unexpected mechanism might explain the beneficial effect of P140 peptide in treated MRL/lpr mice.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21173017 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Page N, Gros F, Schall N, DÃ©cossas M, Bagnard D, Briand JP, Muller S</author>\n    <category>Ann Rheum Dis</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21173017</guid>\n</item>	7	1294614034

The experimental study of Î²(2)-microglobulin structure, dynamics, and thermodynamics in solution, at atomic detail, along the pathway leading to fibril formation is difficult because the onset of disorder and aggregation prevents signal resolution in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance experiments. Moreover, it is difficult to characterize conformers in exchange equilibrium. To gain insight (at atomic level) on processes for which experimental information is available at molecular or supramolecular level, molecular dynamics simulations have been widely used in the last decade. Here, we use molecular dynamics to address three key aspects of Î²(2)-microglobulin, which are known to be relevant to amyloid formation: (1) 60 ns molecular dynamics simulations of Î²(2)-microglobulin in trifluoroethanol and in conditions mimicking low pH are used to study the behavior of the protein in environmental conditions that are able to trigger amyloid formation; (2) adaptive biasing force molecular dynamics simulation is used to force cis-trans isomerization at Proline 32 and to calculate the relative free energy in the folded and unfolded state. The native-like trans-conformer (known as intermediate 2 and determining the slow phase of refolding), is simulated for 10 ns, detailing the possible link between cis-trans isomerization and conformational disorder; (3) molecular dynamics simulation of highly concentrated doxycycline (a molecule able to suppress fibril formation) in the presence of Î²(2)-microglobulin provides details of the binding modes of the drug and a rationale for its effect.

Yet, recognition, processing and repair of DNA damage occur within the nucleoprotein complex of chromatin which is dynamic in nature, capable of rapid unfolding, disassembling, assembling and refolding. The present work reviews experimental work designed to investigate the impact of chromatin dynamics and chromosome conformation changes during cell-cycle in the formation of chromosomal aberrations. Using conventional cytogenetics and premature chromosome condensation to visualize interphase chromatin, the data presented support the hypothesis that chromatin dynamic changes during cell-cycle are important determinants in the conversion of sub-microscopic DNA lesions into chromatid breaks. Consequently, the type and yield of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations at a given cell-cycle-stage depends on the combined effect of DNA repair processes and chromatin dynamics, which is cell-cycle-regulated and subject to up- or down-regulation following radiation exposure or genetic alterations. This new hypothesis is used to explain the variability in radiosensitivity observed at various cell-cycle-stages, among mutant cells and cells of different origin, or among different individuals, and to revisit unresolved issues and unanswered questions. In addition, it is used to better understand hypersensitivity of AT cells and to provide an improved predictive G2-assay for evaluating radiosensitivity at individual level. Finally, experimental data at single cell level obtained using hybrid cells suggest that the proposed hypothesis applies only to the irradiated component of the hybrid.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21185845 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Terzoudi GI, Hatzi VI, Donta-Bakoyianni C, Pantelias GE</author>\n    <category>Mutat Res</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21185845</guid>\n</item>	9	1294609218

In vivo, AÎ² is generated by sequential cleavage of Î²-CTF within the Î³-secretase module. To investigate Î³-secretase function, in vitro assays are in widespread use which require a recombinant Î²-CTF substrate expressed in bacteria and purified from inclusion bodies, termed C100. So far, little is known about the conformation of C100 under different conditions of purification and refolding. Since C100 dimerization influences the efficiency and specificity of Î³-secretase cleavage, it is also of great interest to determine the secondary structure and the oligomeric state of the synthetic substrate as well as the binding properties of small molecules named Î³-secretase modulators (GSMs) which we could previously show to modulate APP transmembrane sequence interactions (Richter et al. (2010) PNAS 107, 14597-14602). Here, we use circular dichroism and continuous-wave electron spin resonance measurements to show that C100 purified in a buffer containing SDS at micelle-forming concentrations adopts a highly stable Î±-helical conformation, in which it shows little tendency to aggregate or to form higher oligomers than dimers. By surface plasmon resonance analysis and molecular modeling we show that the GSM sulindac sulfide binds to C100 and has a preference for C100 dimers.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21186781 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Botev A, MÃ¼nter LM, Wenzel R, Richter L, Althoff V, Ismer J, Gerling U, Weise C, Koksch B, Hildebrand PW, Bittl R, Multhaup G</author>\n    <category>Biochemistry</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21186781</guid>\n</item>	12	1294837926

We directly measured hydrogen/deuterium exchange rates on the urea-denatured hFGF-1 to obtain the information with regard to the persistent residual interaction(s) in the unfolded hFGF-1. Thirty-eight residues whose heteronuclear single quantum coherence cross-peaks can be observed after exchange show higher protections than those predicted for the same residues in a random coil conformation, suggesting the existence of residual structure(s). The urea-denaturation of hFGF-1 tested by both circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy indicated that the unfolding process is a cooperative two-state process and that the residual structures observed did not originate from the existence of a partially structured intermediate. The coincident disappearance of the native heteronuclear single quantum coherence cross-peaks during the urea-denaturation process suggests that the residual structures observed contain no nativelike interactions. The protected residues (fold ons) in the urea-denatured state are mostly those that exchange slowly in the native state H/D exchange. The distribution of these fold ons in the native structure of hFGF-1 suggests that the refolding starts by collisions between the residual structures (microdomains) between the Î²-strands VI and VII, and between the Î²-strands II and III, which appear to be two independent refolding coordinates during the refolding process.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21190667 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Wang HM, Yu C</author>\n    <category>Biophys J</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21190667</guid>\n</item>	140	1294837918

In vitro protein refolding is severely impeded by the aggregation of folding intermediates during the folding process, so inhibition of the aggregation is the most effective approach to high-efficiency protein refolding. We have herein found that electrostatic repulsion between like-charged protein and ion exchange gel beads can greatly suppress the aggregation of folding intermediates, leading to the significant increase of native protein recovery. This finding is extensively demonstrated with three different proteins and four kinds of ion-exchange resins when the protein and ion-exchange gel are either positively or negatively charged at the refolding conditions. It is remarkable that the enhancing effect is significant at very high protein concentrations, such as 4 mg/mL lysozyme (positively charged) and 2 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (negatively charged). Moreover, the folding kinetics is not compromised by the presence of the resins, so fast protein refolding is realized at high protein concentrations. It was not realistic by any other approaches. The working mechanism of the like-charged resin is considered due to the charge repulsion that could induce oriented alignment of protein molecules near the charged surface, leading to the inhibition of protein aggregation. The molecular crowding effect induced by the charge repulsion may also contribute to accelerating protein folding. The refolding method with like-charged ion exchangers is simple to perform, and the key material is easy to separate for recycling. Moreover, because ion exchangers can work as adsorbents of oppositely charged impurities, an operation of simultaneous protein refolding and purification is possible. All the characters are desirable for preparative refolding of therapeutic proteins expressed in bacteria as inclusion bodies.

The spectroscopic results show that in all cases the protein folded correctly but that the copper-content, enzymatic activity, and redox-cycling ability depended on the mutation. One mutant was fully functional, and two others completely lacked copper, the lysyl tyrosyl quinone (LTQ) cofactor, and activity. A fourth incorporated copper but lacked LTQ and enzymatic activity. The remaining mutant incorporated copper and had redox-cycling activity but no enzymatic activity. The results suggest that three of the five histidines in the putative copper-binding domain, H292, H294, H296, are the copper ligands and essential to the formation of LTQ.

We found that this mutant incorporates (3)H-thymidine at higher rates than the parental strain and displays overinitiation, hypermutator and filamentation phenotypes with the occurrence of anucleated cells. Moreover, YbbN functions as a bona fide chaperone in the refolding of the urea-unfolded Î²-clamp. These results suggest that the DNA replication and cell division defects of the ybbN mutant might best be explained by chaperone functions of YbbN in the biogenesis of DNA polymerase 3 holoenzyme.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21195694 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Le HT, Gautier V, Kthiri F, Kohiyama M, Katayama T, Richarme G</author>\n    <category>Biochem Biophys Res Commun</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21195694</guid>\n</item>	13	1295104222

Greater tissue penetration and hence enhanced cell toxicity are obtained with a smaller version of antibodies. While the whole antibody can be readily produced via mammalian expression system, antibody fragments often require refolding of insoluble proteins. Here we report a new refolding method for antibody fragments using a novel amino acid-based detergent as a solubilizing agent and arginine-assisted refolding. Inclusion bodies of antibody fragments were solubilized by 2.5% lauroyl-L-Glu (C12-L-Glu) and successfully refolded by multi-step dilution into a buffer solution containing arginine hydrochloride and thiol/disulfide-exchange reagents. Adjustment of temperature was found to be critical for increase in the refolding yield. Although each protein requires appropriate optimization, solubilization by C12-L-Glu and dilution refolding assisted by arginine can generate the native, functional antibody fragments. The procedure should enable us to utilize bacterial expression systems for the large-scale manufacturing.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21195184 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Kudou M, Ejima D, Sato H, Yumioka R, Arakawa T, Tsumoto K</author>\n    <category>Protein Expr Purif</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21195184</guid>\n</item>	9	1295104146

Relatively little is known about the folding energy landscapes of such proteins, or how they have evolved. We explore those questions here by designing a unique knotted protein structure. Biophysical characterization and X-ray crystal structure determination show that the designed protein folds to the intended configuration, tying itself in a knot in the process, and that it folds reversibly. The protein folds to its native, knotted configuration approximately 20 times more slowly than a control protein, which was designed to have a similar tertiary structure but to be unknotted. Preliminary kinetic experiments suggest a complicated folding mechanism, providing opportunities for further characterization. The findings illustrate a situation where a protein is able to successfully traverse a complex folding energy landscape, though the amino acid sequence of the protein has not been subjected to evolutionary pressure for that ability. The success of the design strategy--connecting two monomers of an intertwined homodimer into a single protein chain--supports a model for evolution of knotted structures via gene duplication.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21068371 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> King NP, Jacobitz AW, Sawaya MR, Goldschmidt L, Yeates TO</author>\n    <category>Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21068371</guid>\n</item>	4	1295565417

A combination of intrinsic/extrinsic fluorescence (FL), circular dichroism, calorimetry, chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, and laser light scattering were used to characterize unfolding, refolding, native colloidal interactions, aggregate structure and morphology, and aggregate dissociation. Lower pH led to larger net repulsive colloidal interactions, decreased thermal stability of Fc and Fab regions, and increased solubility of thermally accelerated aggregates. Unfolding of the Fab domains, and possibly the CH3 domain, was inferred as a key step in the formation of aggregation-prone monomers. High-molecular-weight soluble aggregates displayed nonnative secondary structure, had a semi-rigid chain morphology, and bound thioflavin T (ThT), consistent with at least a portion of the monomer forming amyloid-like structures. Soluble aggregates also formed during monomer refolding under conditions moving from high to low denaturant concentrations. Both thermally and chemically induced aggregates showed similar ThT binding and secondary structural changes, and were noncovalent based on dissociation in concentrated guanidine hydrochloride solutions. Changes in intrinsic FL during chemical versus thermal unfolding suggest a greater degree of structural change during chemical unfolding, although aggregation proceeded through partially unfolded monomers in both cases.

HÎ³D-Crys exhibits two homologous crystallin domains, each containing two Greek key motifs with eight Î²-strands. Six aromatic pairs (four Tyr/Tyr, one Tyr/Phe and one Phe/Phe) are present in the Î²-hairpin sequences of the Greek keys. Ultraviolet damage to the aromatic residues in lens crystallins may contribute to the genesis of cataract. Mutant proteins with these aromatic residues substituted with alanines were constructed and expressed in E. coli. All mutant proteins except F115A and F117A had lower thermal stability than the WT protein. In equilibrium experiments in guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl), all mutant proteins had lower thermodynamic stability than the WT protein. N-terminal domain (N-td) substitutions shifted the N-td transition to lower GuHCl concentration, but the C-terminal domain (C-td) transition remained unaffected. C-td substitutions led to a more cooperative unfolding/refolding process, with both the N-td and C-td transitions shifted to lower GuHCl concentration. The aromatic pairs conserved for each Greek key motif (Greek key pairs) had larger contributions to both thermal stability and thermodynamic stability than the other pairs. Aromatic-aromatic interaction was estimated as 1.5-2.0 kcal/mol. In kinetic experiments, N-td substitutions accelerated the early phase of unfolding, while C-td substitutions accelerated the late phase, suggesting independent domain unfolding. Only substitutions of the second Greek key pair of each crystallin domain slowed refolding. The second Greek keys may provide nucleation sites during the folding of the double-Greek-key crystallin domains.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21213250 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Kong F, King J</author>\n    <category>Protein Sci</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21213250</guid>\n</item>	41	1295685115

METHODS: Frozen matrix was sampled, stored frozen at various temperatures and analyzed by SEC over time. RESULTS: Aggregation increased with time at -20Â°C but not at -40Â°C or -10Â°C. The cause of the instability was the crystallization of freeze-concentrated trehalose from the frozen solute when the storage temperature exceeds the glass transition temperature of the matrix (-29Â°C). Crystallization at -20Â°C deprives the protein of the cryoprotectant, leading to a slow increase in aggregation. Storage at -10Â°C also leads to crystallization of trehalose but no increase in aggregation. It is hypothesized that significantly higher mobility in the matrix at -10Â°C allows protein molecules that are unfolded at the ice interface on freezing to refold back before significant aggregation can occur. In contrast, lack of mobility at -40Â°C prevents crystallization, refolding, and aggregation. CONCLUSIONS: Aggregation in the frozen state when stored above the glass transition temperature is a consequence of balance between rate of crystallization leading to loss of cryoprotectant, rate of aggregation of the unfolded protein molecules, and rate of refolding that prevents aggregation.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21213025 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Singh SK, Kolhe P, Mehta AP, Chico SC, Lary AL, Huang M</author>\n    <category>Pharm Res</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21213025</guid>\n</item>	4	1295685115

Despite the clinical importance of HBx, there is little progress in anti-HBx drug development strategies due to shortage of HBx from native sources. Consistent expression of HBx as insoluble inclusion bodies within various expression systems has largely hindered HBx manufacturing via economical biosynthesis routes. Confronted by this roadblock, this study aims to quantitatively understand HBx protein behaviour in solution that will guide the rational development of a refolding-based bioprocess for HBx production. Second virial coefficient (SVC) measurements were employed to study the effects of varying physicochemical parameters on HBx intermolecular protein interaction. The SVC results suggest that covalent HBx aggregates play a key role in protein destabilisation during refolding. The use of an SVC-optimised refolding environment yielded bioactive and soluble HBx proteins from the denatured-reduced inclusion body state. This study provides new knowledge on HBx solubility behaviour in vitro, which is important in structure-function elucidation behaviour of this hydrophobic protein. Importantly, a rational refolding-based Escherichia coli bioprocess that can deliver purified and soluble HBx at large scale is successfully developed, which opens the way for rapid preparation of soluble HBx for further clinical and characterisation studies.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21212947 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Basu A, Chen WN, Leong SS</author>\n    <category>Appl Microbiol Biotechnol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21212947</guid>\n</item>	16	1296014615

According to activity and gene screening, filamentous fungi are a rich source of nitrilases distinct in evolution from their widely examined bacterial counterparts. However, fungal nitrilases have been less explored than the bacterial ones. Nitrilases are typically heterogeneous in their quaternary structures, forming short spirals and extended filaments, these features making their structural studies difficult. RESULTS: A nitrilase gene was amplified by PCR from the cDNA library of Aspergillus niger K10. The PCR product was ligated into expression vectors pET-30(+) and pRSET B to construct plasmids pOK101 and pOK102, respectively. The recombinant nitrilase (Nit-ANigRec) expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-Gold(DE3)(pOK101/pTf16) was purified with an about 2-fold increase in specific activity and 35 % yield. The apparent subunit size was 42.7 kDa, which is approx. 4 kDa higher than that of the enzyme isolated from the native organism (Nit-ANigWT), indicating post-translational cleavage in the enzyme's native environment. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that a C-terminal peptide (Val327 - Asn356) was present in Nit-ANigRec but missing in Nit-ANigWT and Asp298-Val313 peptide was shortened to Asp298-Arg310 in Nit-ANigWT. Enzymes Nit-ANigRec and Nit-ANigWT differed in substrate specificity, acid/amide ratio, reaction optima and stability. Refolded recombinant enzyme stored for one month at 4 degreesC was fractionated by gel filtration, and fractions were examined by electron microscopy. The late fractions were further analyzed by analytical centrifugation and dynamic light scattering, and shown to consist of a rather homogeneous protein species composed of 12-16 subunits. This hypothesis was consistent with electron microscopy and our modelling of the multimeric nitrilase, which supports an arrangement of dimers into helical segments as a plausible structural solution. CONCLUSIONS: The nitrilase from Aspergillus niger K10 is highly homologous (at least 86 %) with proteins deduced from gene sequencing in Aspergillus and Penicillium genera. As the first of these proteins, it was shown to exhibit nitrilase activity towards organic nitriles. The comparison of the Nit-ANigRec and Nit-ANigWT suggested that the catalytic properties of nitrilases may be changed due to missing posttranslational cleavage of the former enzyme. Nit-ANigRec exhibits a lower tendency to form filaments and, moreover, the sample homogeneity can be further improved by in vitro protein refolding. The homogeneous protein species consisting of short spirals is expected to be more suitable for structural studies.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21210990 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Kaplan O, Bezouska K, Plihal O, Ettrich R, Kulik N, Vanek O, Kavan D, Benada O, Malandra A, Sveda O, Vesela AB, Rinagelova A, Slamova K, Cantarella M, Felsberg J, Duskova J, Dohnalek J, Kotik M, Kren V, Martinkova L</author>\n    <category>BMC Biotechnol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21210990</guid>\n</item>	0	1296014615

In plants, this enzyme is poorly characterized and only the maize plastidial TGase gene (tgz) has been cloned. The tgz gene (Patent WWO03102128) had been subcloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells, and the recombinant protein (TGZp) was present mainly in inclusion bodies (IB) fraction. In this work, after overexpression of TGZ15p and SDS-PAGE IB fraction analysis, bands about 65 and 56 kDa were obtained. Western blot, alkylation and MALDI-TOF/TOF analyses indicated that the 56 kDa band corresponded to a truncated sequence from the native TGZ15p (expected MW 65 kDa), by elimination of a chloroplast signal peptide fragment during expression processing. So that large-scale protein production and protein crystallization can be applied, we characterized the TGZ15p enzyme activity in the IB protein fraction, with and without refolding. Results indicate that it presented the biochemical characteristics of other described TGases, showing a certain plant-substrate preference. Solubilization of the IB fraction with Triton X-100 as nondenaturing detergent yielded active TGZ without the need for refolding, giving activity values comparable to those of the refolded protein, indicating that this is a valuable, faster way to obtain TGZ active protein.

Among the modifications most often incorporated into therapeutic ONs are phosphorothioate (PT) linkages. The PT linkage introduces an additional chiral center at phosphorus to the chiral centers in D-ribose (and 2-deoxy-d-ribose) of the nucleic acid. Therefore, modified linkages can produce a diastereoisomer pair ([Rp] and [Sp]) at each PT linkage. These isomers are of identical length, sequence, charge and mass, and are not reliably separated by most chromatographic approaches (e.g., reversed phase chromatography) unless the ON is very short. Further these isomers are not distinguishable by single-stage mass spectrometry. During chromatography of a purified anti-NGF (nerve growth factor) aptamer containing 37 bases with 2 PT linkages by monolithic pellicular anion-exchange (pAE) column, we observed four components. The four components were postulated to be: (i) distinct folding conformations; (ii) fully and partially athioated aptamers; or (iii) PT diastereoisomers. Fractionation of the components, followed by de- and re- naturation failed to produce the original forms by refolding, eliminating option (i). Mass spectrometry of the fractionated, desalted samples revealed no significant mass differences, eliminating option (ii). Oxidative conversion of the PT to phosphodiester (PO) linkages in each of the purified components produced a single chromatographic peak, co-eluting with authentic PO aptamer, and having the PO aptamer mass. We conclude that the components resolved by pAE chromatography are diastereoisomers arising from the two PT linkages. Hence, pAE chromatography further enhances characterization of ON therapeutics harboring limited PT linkages and having up to 37 bases.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21216401 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Thayer JR, Wu Y, Hansen E, Angelino MD, Rao S</author>\n    <category>J Chromatogr A</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21216401</guid>\n</item>	0	1296276941

On the bare gold surface of a QCM sensor chip, approximately 60nm of hydrophilic polystyrene (phi-PS) thin film that specifically binds the polystyrene-binding peptide (PS-tag) was prepared by spin-coating and O(2)-plasma irradiation. When the adsorption of PS-tag-fused anti-ED-B scFv (scFv-PS) onto the phi-PS surface was directly monitored, the maximum density of scFv-PS attained was 1.56Î¼g/cm(2), 1.6-times higher than that of scFv. The specific antigen-binding activity of scFv-PS after solid-phase refolding increased with the density of immobilized scFv-PS, and, consequently, activity 1.7 times higher than that of scFv was retained. The scFv-PS-immobilized QCM sensor chip rapidly allowed the detection of clear signals for antigen at the range of 0.1-10Î¼g/ml, while no signal was detectable for 10Î¼g/ml BSA as a negative control. The scFv-PS-immobilized QCM sensor developed in the present study will therefore be very useful for the rapid and highly sensitive detection of biomarkers, and should be applicable to clinical diagnosis.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21215695 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Kumada Y, Sasaki E, Kishimoto M</author>\n    <category>J Biosci Bioeng</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21215695</guid>\n</item>	9	1296276941

Here we show that two human proteins, GPx7 and GPx8, labeled as secreted glutathione peroxidases, are actually ER resident PDI-peroxidases. In vitro, when GPx7 or GPx8 are added to a folding protein along with protein disulfide isomerase and peroxide, they enable efficient oxidative refolding of a reduced denatured protein to occur. Furthermore, both GPx7 and GPx8 interact with Ero1Î± in vivo and GPx7 significantly increases oxygen consumption by Ero1Î± in vitro.

The ranking of expression level of the five fused proinsulins was H27Râ‰«T10R&gt;B5K&gt;T13Râ‰ˆB5R. In particular, the expression level of H27R was more than double (60âˆ¼70%) the level of the other fused proinsulins, and this high expression level led to large amounts of SSPPI, folded proinsulin and insulin. Changes to the leader peptide structure affected not only protein expression level, but also refolding yield because the leader peptide affects protein conformation and hydrophobicity. The refolding yield of H27R was 85% at 500 L pilot scale. This high refolding yield was caused by the hydrophilic character of H27R. However, the ÃŸ-mercaptoethanol concentration needed for refolding and the pH required to precipitate impurities after refolding had to be changed for high refolding yield. To avoid using CNBr, which is used to cleave fusion proteins, we used lysine and arginine linkers to connect the fusion protein and proinsulin. This fusion protein could be simultaneously cleaved by trypsin during enzymatic conversion to eliminate the C-peptide. The length and kind of leader peptide did not affect the enzyme reaction rate. Only the leader peptide linker connecting the B-chain influenced enzyme reaction rate. By testing several leader peptides, we constructed a new strain with 30% increased productivity based on expression level, refolding yield and enzyme reaction.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21219941 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Min CK, Son YJ, Kim CK, Park SJ, Lee JW</author>\n    <category>J Biotechnol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21219941</guid>\n</item>	69	1296631736

To test for possible functional differences or/and substrate specificity, we assessed the effect of overexpression of each of these HSPs on refolding of heat-denatured luciferase and on the suppression of aggregation of a non-foldable polyglutamine (poly-Q) expanded Huntingtin fragment. Overexpressed chaperones that suppressed poly-Q aggregation were found not to be able to stimulate luciferase refolding. Inversely, chaperones that supported luciferase refolding were poor suppressors of polyQ aggregation. This was not related to client specificity per se, as the poly-Q aggregation inhibitors often also suppressed heat-induced aggregation of luciferase. Surprisingly, the exclusively heat-inducible HSPA6 lacks both luciferase refolding and poly-Q aggregation-suppressing activities. Furthermore, whereas overexpression of HSPA1A protected cells from heat-induced cell death, overexpression of HSPA6 did not. Inversely, siRNA mediated blocking of HSPA6 did not impair the development of heat-induced thermotolerance. Yet, HSPA6 has a functional substrate-binding domain and possesses intrinsic ATPase activity that is as high as that of the canonical HSPA1A when stimulated by J-proteins. In vitro data suggest that this may be relevant to substrate specificity as purified HSPA6 could not chaperone heat-unfolded luciferase but was able to assist in reactivation of heat-unfolded p53. So, even within the highly sequence-conserved HSPA family, functional differentiation is larger than expected with HSPA6 being an extreme example that may have evolved to maintain specific critical functions under conditions of severe stress.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21231916 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Hageman J, van Waarde-Verhagen M, Zylicz A, Walerych D, Kampinga HH</author>\n    <category>Biochem J</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21231916</guid>\n</item>	0	1296809539

Intrinsic cooperativity of binding sharpens force-extension curves and causes enhancement of fluctuation of extension and protein occupation. This model also allows us to estimate the intrinsic cooperativity in experiments by measuring the peak value of the slope of extension versus chemical-potential curves. This analysis suggests the presence of force-dependent cooperativity even in the absence of explicit intrinsic (energetic) cooperativity. To further understand this effect, we analyze a model with a pair of bends at variable spacing to obtain a spacing-dependent free energy of interaction between the two proteins. We find that the interaction is always attractive and has an exponential decay as a function of bend spacing. For forces greater than k_{B}T/A , where A is the persistence length, the interaction decay length is approximately [k_{B}TA/(4f)]^{1/2} in accord with theoretical expectations. However, the force dependence of the strength of the interaction is more complex. For short interprotein separations, the interaction strength saturates at a level which varies roughly as f^{1/2} , while at longer separations the amplitude of the exponential decay increases faster than linearly with force. Our results can be applied to single molecule experiments to measure the cooperativity between DNA-bending proteins or between other molecules which deform the semiflexible polymer with which they bind. Force-mediated interaction of DNA-bending proteins suggests a mechanism whereby tension in DNA in vivo could alter the distribution of proteins bound along DNA, causing chromosome refolding, or changes in gene expression.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21230499 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Zhang H, Marko JF</author>\n    <category>Phys Rev E Stat Nonlin Soft Matter Phys</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21230499</guid>\n</item>	0	1296897322

FCS offers the unique possibility to vary the equilibrium constant in two-state kinetics, for instance, the unfolding and refolding of biomolecules, over many orders of magnitude due to the force dependence of the respective rates. We discuss two different kinds of counting statistics, the event counting usually employed in the statistical analysis of two-state kinetics and additionally the so-called cycle counting. While in the former case all transitions are counted, cycle counting means that we focus on one type of transitions. This might be advantageous in particular if the equilibrium constant is much larger or much smaller than unity because in these situations the temporal resolution of the experimental setup might not allow to capture all transitions of an event-counting analysis. We discuss how an analysis of FCS data for complex systems exhibiting dynamic disorder might be performed yielding information about the detailed force dependence of the transition rates and about the time scale of the dynamic disorder. In addition, the question as to which extent the kinetic scheme can be viewed as a Markovian two-state model is discussed.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21230462 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Diezemann G, Schlesier T, Geil B, Janshoff A</author>\n    <category>Phys Rev E Stat Nonlin Soft Matter Phys</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21230462</guid>\n</item>	0	1296897322

Pioneering pulsed HX experiments have shown that the C-terminal Î²-hairpin forms early during refolding. This is puzzling since the Asn113-Pro114 bond is predominately trans at this stage and this conformation destabilizes the native monomer. RNase A, when refolded at high concentration, forms a series of 3D domain-swapped oligomers. In the oligomers formed by C-terminal Î²-strand swapping, Asn113-Pro114 is trans and permits the formation of a new intersubunit Î²-sheet.

Such species could account for the HX results while comfortably accommodating Asn113-Pro114 in the trans conformation.

The protocol was applied for three phlebovirus NPs, allowing an optimized production strategy for each of them. Remarkably, the Rift Valley fever virus NP was purified as a trimer under native conditions and yielded protein crystals whereas the refolded version could be purified as a dimer. Yields of trimeric Toscana virus NP were higher from denaturing than from native condition and lead to crystals. The production of Sandfly Fever Sicilian virus NP failed in both protocols.

Intravesical administration is an important treatment against superficial bladder cancer and CD40L is essential for the protective anti-tumor immunity. In situ gene therapy with CD40L was demonstrated to successfully inhibit tumor cell growth in the orthotopic mouse model of bladder cancer. In the present study, we prepared streptavidin (SA)-tagged sCD40L and developed a novel immunotherapy for superficial bladder cancer based on the strong interaction between streptavidin and biotin. Material and methods. The SA-sCD40L fusion protein was expressed in E. coli and purified on the Ni-NTA column. After refolding with dialysis, the bi-function of the fusion protein was determined by flow cytometric analysis for streptaidin-mediated surface modification of MB49 bladder cancer cells and a mouse B cell CD40L-dependent proliferation assay. The mouse orthotopic model of MB49 superficial bladder cancer was used to evaluate the efficacy of SA-sCD40L immunotherapy. Results. The SA-sCD40L fusion protein exhibited both full biotin-binding property and CD40L bioactivity. After intravesical instillation, the SA-sCD40L bi-functional fusion protein was durably immobilized on the biotinylated mucosal surface of bladder wall for up to four days. The SA-sCD40L treatment significantly prolonged the survival of MB49 tumor-bearing mice and cured 50% of mice with MB49 superficial bladder cancer without significant adverse effects. In addition, more tumor-infiltrating CD4(+)or CD8(+) T cells were observed in SA-sCD40L-treated group. Conclusion. Intravesical immobilization of SA-sCD40L elicited a strong and long-lasting immunity against the MB49 bladder cancer.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21247263 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Zhang Z, Xu X, Zhang X, Chen X, Chen Q, Dong L, Hu Z, Li J, Gao J</author>\n    <category>Acta Oncol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21247263</guid>\n</item>	0	1297401090

It was found that a partially unfolded structure of lysozyme starts to form when the Î²-casein/lysozyme molar ratio is above 0.7, and the structure forms exclusively when the Î²-casein/lysozyme molar ratio is above 1.6. This partially unfolded state of lysozyme loses most of its tertiary structure and after heating, the denatured lysozyme molecules are trapped in the charged coatings of Î²-casein micelles and cannot refold upon cooling. The thus obtained protein complex can be viewed as a kind of special polyelectrolyte complex micelle. The net charge ratios of the two proteins and the ionic strength of the dispersions can significantly modulate the electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between the two proteins. Our present work may have implications for the nanoparticle protein engineering therapy in the biomedicine field and may provide a better understanding of the principles governing the protein-protein interactions.

Polyglutamic acid (PGA) forms Î±-helical peptides in aqueous solution and is an ideal model system to study the helix-coil transition. Melting curves were monitored with CD and FTIR as a function of pD. At low pD, PGA aggregates at temperatures above 323Â K, whereas at pD &gt;5, unfolding and refolding are reversible. At pD 5.4, a helix-coil transition occurs with a transition temperature T (m) of 307Â K. At slightly higher pD of 6.2, the peptide conformation is already in a coil structure and only small conformational changes occur upon heating. We determined the equilibrium constant for the reversible helix-coil transition at pD 5.4. The dynamics of this transition was measured at single IR wavelengths after a nanosecond laser-excited temperature jump of âˆ†TÂ ~Â 10Â K. Relaxation constants decreased with increasing peptide temperature. Folding and unfolding rates as well as activation energies were extracted based on a two-state model.

Here we report what we believe to be the first molecular simulations of mutually exclusive folding in an engineered two-domain protein switch, providing a direct view of how folding of one protein drives unfolding of the other in a barnase-ubiquitin fusion protein. These simulations successfully capture the experimental effects of interdomain linker length and ligand binding on the extent of unfolding in the less stable domain. In addition, the effect of linker length on the potential for oligomerization, which eliminates switch activity, is in qualitative agreement with analytical ultracentrifugation experiments. We also perform what we believe to be the first study of protein unfolding via progressive localized compression. Finally, we are able to explore the kinetics of mutually exclusive folding by determining the effect of linker length on rates of unfolding and refolding of each protein domain.

The experimental study of Î²(2) -microglobulin structure, dynamics, and thermodynamics in solution, at atomic detail, along the pathway leading to fibril formation is difficult because the onset of disorder and aggregation prevents signal resolution in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance experiments. Moreover, it is difficult to characterize conformers in exchange equilibrium. To gain insight (at atomic level) on processes for which experimental information is available at molecular or supramolecular level, molecular dynamics simulations have been widely used in the last decade. Here, we use molecular dynamics to address three key aspects of Î²(2) -microglobulin, which are known to be relevant to amyloid formation: (1) 60 ns molecular dynamics simulations of Î²(2) -microglobulin in trifluoroethanol and in conditions mimicking low pH are used to study the behavior of the protein in environmental conditions that are able to trigger amyloid formation; (2) adaptive biasing force molecular dynamics simulation is used to force cis-trans isomerization at Proline 32 and to calculate the relative free energy in the folded and unfolded state. The native-like trans-conformer (known as intermediate 2 and determining the slow phase of refolding), is simulated for 10 ns, detailing the possible link between cis-trans isomerization and conformational disorder; (3) molecular dynamics simulation of highly concentrated doxycycline (a molecule able to suppress fibril formation) in the presence of Î²(2) -microglobulin provides details of the binding modes of the drug and a rationale for its effect.

Both pathogens are still important causes of diarrhea in children and adults in many developing and industrialized countries. Considering the fact that antibodies are important tools in the detection of several pathogens, an anti-intimin IgG2b monoclonal antibody was previously raised from immunized mouse with the conserved sequence of the intimin molecule (int388-667). In immunoblotting assays this monoclonal antibody presented an excellent specificity. Despite of the good performance, the monoclonal antibody failed to detect some EPEC and EHEC isolates harboring variant amino acids within the 338-667 regions of intimin molecules. Consequently, motivated by its use for diagnosis purposes in this study we aimed the cloning and expression the single chain fragment variable from this monoclonal antibody (scFv). RESULTS: Anti-intimin hybridoma mRNA was extracted, reversely transcripted to cDNA and the light and heavy chains of variable fragment from the antibody were amplified using commercial primers. The amplified chains were cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector. Specific primers were designed and used in an amplification and chains linkage strategy, obtaining the scFv, which in turn was cloned into pAE vector. E. coli BL21(DE3)plys strain was transformed with pAE scFv-intimin plasmid and subjected to induction of protein expression. The scFv anti-intimin expressed as inclusion bodies (insoluble fraction), was denatured, purified and submitted to refolding. The protein yield was 1 mg of protein per 100 mL of bacterial culture. To test the functionality of the scFv, ELISA and immunofluorescence assays were performed, showing that 275 ng of scFv reacted with 2 mg of purified intimin, resulting in an absorbance of 0.75 in 492 nm. The immunofluorescence assay showed a strong reactivity with EPEC E2348/69.

In the initial conformation of HA its fusogenic subunit, the transmembrane protein HA2, is locked in a metastable conformation by the receptor-binding HA1 subunit of HA. Acidification in the endosome triggers HA2 refolding towards the final lowest energy conformation. Is the fusion process driven by this final conformation or, as often suggested, by the energy released by protein restructuring? Here we explored structural properties as well as the fusogenic activity of the full-sized trimeric HA2(1-185) (here called HA2*) that presents the final conformation of the HA2 ectodomain. We found HA2* to mediate fusion between lipid bilayers and between biological membranes in a low pH-dependent manner. Two mutations known to inhibit HA-mediated fusion strongly inhibit the fusogenic activity of HA2*. At surface densities similar to those of HA in the influenza virus particle, HA2* formed small fusion pores but did not expand them. Our results confirm that the HA1 subunit responsible for receptor binding as well as the transmembrane and cytosolic domains of HA2 are not required for fusion pore opening and substantiate the hypothesis that the final form of HA2 is more important for fusion than the conformational change that generates this form.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21292763 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Kim CS, Epand RF, Leikina E, Epand RM, Chernomordik LV</author>\n    <category>J Biol Chem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21292763</guid>\n</item>	19	1298621051

In clinical practice the bone grafting materials on the basis of rhBMP-2 are widely applied; the Russian analogues of similar materials are not produced. The fragment of the bmp2gene coding for a mature protein was cloned in Escherichia coli. The effective overproducing strain of rhBMP-2 was created on a basis of the E. coli BL21 (DE3). The rhBMP-2 production was about 25% of total cell protein. The biologically active dimeric form of rhBMP-2 was obtained by isolation and purification of protein from inclusion bodies with subsequent refolding. The rhBMP-2 sample with more than 80% of the dimeric form was obtained, which is able to interact with specific antibodies to BMP-2. Biological activity of the received rhBMP-2 samples was shown in the in vitro experiments by induction of alkaline phosphatase synthesis in C2C12 and C3H10T1/2 cell cultures. On model of the ectopic osteogenesis it was shown that received rhBMP-2 possesses biological activity in vivo, causing tissue calcification in the place of an injection. The protein activity in vivo depends on way of protein introduction and characteristics of protein sample: rhBMP-2 may be introduced in an acid or basic buffer solution, with or without the carrier. The offered method of rhBMP-2 isolation and purification results in increasing common protein yield as well as the maintenance of biologically active dimeric form in comparison with the analogues described in the literature.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21290825 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author/>\n    <category>Mol Biol (Mosk)</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21290825</guid>\n</item>	49	1299065390

Recombinant proteins can also precipitate naturally as inclusion bodies due to various influences during over-expression in the host cell. Although this phenomenon permits easier initial separation from native proteins, these inclusion bodies must carefully be differentially solubilised so as to reform functional, correctly folded proteins.

Both the oxidizing power and oxidation specificity of cystamine are enhanced by n-octanoyl or n-hexanoyl tail. N-octanoyl and n-hexanoyl cystamine are very effective to facilitate oxidative protein refolding at strong reducing environments. In the presence of 0.42 mM DTT, the activity recovery of lysozyme is over 90% by 90-min refolding with 0.1 mM n-octanoyl cystamine and 0.1 mM cystamine as oxidant, while almost no activity is recovered with 0.2 mM GSSG by 160-min refolding. For the refolding of 0.2 mg/mL lysozyme, with 0.6 mM n-hexanoyl cystamine and 1.12 mM residual DTT as redox agents, the activity recovery reaches as high as 93% after refolding for only 20 min. For ribonuclease A (RNase A) refolding, with 0.4 mM n-hexanoyl cystamine and 1.30 mM DTT, the recovery of activity reaches as high as 90% within 3 h. Thus, with n-octanoyl or n-hexanoyl cystamine as the oxidants, the necessity to remove excess DTT in the reduced and denatured protein solutions can be greatly alleviated. With a moderate hydrophobicity, n-hexanoyl cystamine is promising for application in oxidative protein refolding at an extensive concentration range. It is observed that in the oxidative refolding of 0.2 mg/mL lysozyme and RNase A, only about half of n-hexanoyl cystamine is needed when compared to cystamine to achieve the same kinetic effect.

These asparagines are not essential for surface display of pre-fusogenic envelope. Instead, substitution of these residues dramatically disrupts membrane fusion. Our data indicate that, through electrostatic interactions with a chloride ion, the asparagine residues promote assembly and profoundly stabilize the fusion-active structures that are required for viral envelope-mediated membrane fusion. Moreover, the BLV TM structure also reveals a charge-surrounded hydrophobic pocket on the central coiled coil and interactions with basic residues that cluster around this pocket are critical to membrane fusion and form a target for peptide inhibitors of envelope function. Charge-surrounded pockets and electrostatic interactions with small ions are common among class-1 fusion proteins, suggesting that small molecules that specifically target such motifs should prevent assembly of the trimer-of-hairpins and be of value as therapeutic inhibitors of viral entry.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21304939 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Lamb D, SchÃ¼ttelkopf AW, van Aalten DM, Brighty DW</author>\n    <category>PLoS Pathog</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21304939</guid>\n</item>	5	1299945945

The cancer drug target Aurora A is inhibited by the ATP site inhibitor VX680, and published crystal structures show two distinct conformations. In one, a refolded glycine-rich loop creates a stacked Ï€-Ï€ interaction between the conserved aromatic residue of the glycine-rich loop hairpin turn (F144) and the inhibitor. This refolding, associated with binding to a peptide derived from the cofactor TPX2, is absent in the other structure. We use surface plasmon resonance to measure VX680 binding to native and mutant F144A Aurora A kinase domains, with and without the TPX2 peptide. Results show that the F144 aromatic side chain contributes 2 kcal/mol to the VX680 binding energy, independent of the TPX2 peptide. This indicates that distinct VX680 bound conformations of Aurora A cannot be simply correlated with TPX2 binding and that Aurora A retains flexibility when inhibitor-bound. Molecular dynamics simulations show that alternate geometries for the Ï€-Ï€ interactions are feasible in the absence of the rigidifying packing interactions seen in the crystal lattice.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21306143 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Oliveira TM, Ahmad R, Engh RA</author>\n    <category>J Phys Chem A</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21306143</guid>\n</item>	11	1299945945

In plants, this enzyme is poorly characterized and only the maize plastidial TGase gene (tgz) has been cloned. The tgz gene (Patent WWO03102128) had been subcloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells, and the recombinant protein (TGZp) was present mainly in inclusion bodies (IB) fraction. In this work, after overexpression of TGZ15p and SDS-PAGE IB fraction analysis, bands about 65 and 56 kDa were obtained. Western blot, alkylation and MALDI-TOF/TOF analyses indicated that the 56 kDa band corresponded to a truncated sequence from the native TGZ15p (expected MW 65 kDa), by elimination of a chloroplast signal peptide fragment during expression processing. So that large-scale protein production and protein crystallization can be applied, we characterized the TGZ15p enzyme activity in the IB protein fraction, with and without refolding. Results indicate that it presented the biochemical characteristics of other described TGases, showing a certain plant-substrate preference. Solubilization of the IB fraction with Triton X-100 as nondenaturing detergent yielded active TGZ without the need for refolding, giving activity values comparable to those of the refolded protein, indicating that this is a valuable, faster way to obtain TGZ active protein.

AD is a neurodegenerative disease and the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. Current estimates suggest that as many as 5.3 million Americans are living with AD. Recent investigations have uncovered the pathophysiological relevance of APP intracellular trafficking in AD. LR11 is of particular importance due to its role in regulating APP transport and processing. LR11 is a type I transmembrane protein and belongs to a novel family of Vps10p receptors. Using a new expression vector, pMTTH, (MBP- MCS1(multiple cloning site)-Thrombin protease cleavage site-MCS2-TEV protease cleavage site-MCS3-His(6)), we successfully expressed, purified and reconstituted the LR11 transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic (CT) domains into bicelles and detergent micelles for NMR structural studies. This new construct allowed us to overcome several obstacles during sample preparation. MBP fused LR11 TM and LR11TMCT proteins are preferably expressed at high levels in E. coli membrane, making a refolding of the protein unnecessary. The C-terminal His-tag allows for easy separation of the target protein from the truncated products from the C-terminus, and provides a convenient route for screening detergents to produce high quality 2D (1)H-(15)N TROSY spectra. Thrombin protease cleavage is compatible with most of the commonly used detergents, including a direct cleavage at the E. coli membrane surface.

However, when DnaK and its co-chaperone DnaJ are co-produced in cultured insect cells or whole insect larvae (and expectedly, in other heterologous hosts), only positive, folding-related effects of these chaperones are observed, in absence of proteolysis-mediated reduction of recombinant protein yield.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21326941 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> MartÃ­nez-Alonso M, Villaverde A, Ferrer-Miralles N</author>\n    <category>Bioeng Bugs</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21326941</guid>\n</item>	2	1300435689

The Overnight Expressâ„¢ Autoinduction System (OE system) was adopted to skip the laborious induction step of the addition of IPTG. ScFv and scFv-PS began to be expressed after 6h by conventional flask culture (FLC) and by MBC when utilizing the OE system, and similar specific productivity levels were attained during cultivation. In MBC, an important factor that directly affected the production levels was rotational speed during cultivation, suggesting that the mass transfer of oxygen was rate-limiting. In a comparison of the productivity of flask cultures utilizing the 2YT-IPTG and OE systems, MBC utilizing the OE system was the highest, with approximately 1mg of insoluble scFv-PS obtained from each well under optimal conditions (1400rpm). The results of SDS-PAGE and a cross-contamination check indicated that very similar cultivation conditions were attained in each well, without cross-contamination. Thus, MBC using the OE system is very useful for the high-throughput, high-level production of scFv-PS, which can be activated on the surface of hydrophilic PS plates by solid-phase refolding. Therefore, the production of a variety of specific scFv-PSs for cytokines and biomarkers will make possible the construction of sensitive and low-cost antibody microarrays, which will be very useful in clinical diagnosis and biochemical research.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21324737 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Kumada Y, Takase Y, Sasaki E, Kishimoto M</author>\n    <category>J Biosci Bioeng</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21324737</guid>\n</item>	2	1300435689

This prion protein is involved in a fungal self/non-self discrimination process termed heterokaryon incompatibility corresponding to a cell death reaction occurring upon fusion of genetically unlike strains. Two antagonistic allelic variants of this protein exist: HET-s, the prion form of which corresponds to [Het-s] and HET-S, incapable of prion formation. Fusion of a [Het-s] and HET-S strain triggers the incompatibility reaction, so that interaction of HET-S with the [Het-s] prion leads to cell death. HET-s and HET-S are highly homologous two domain proteins with a N-terminal globular domain termed HeLo and a C-terminal unstructured prion forming domain (PFD). The structure of the prion form of the HET-s PFD has been solved by solid state NMR and corresponds to a very well ordered -solenoid fold with a triangular hydrophobic core. The ability to form this -solenoid fold is retained on a distant homolog of HET-s from another fungal species. A model for the mechanism of [Het-s]/HET-S incompatibility has been proposed. It is believe that when interacting with the [Het-s] prion seed, the HET-S Cterminal region adopts the -solenoid fold. This would act as a conformational switch to induce refolding and activation of the HeLo domain which then would exert its toxicity by a yet unknown mechanism.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21334447 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Saupe SJ</author>\n    <category>Semin Cell Dev Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21334447</guid>\n</item>	6	1300865660

In addition, Glc binding does not only stabilize GGBP structure but it also considerably slows down the achievement of the equilibrium between the native protein in GGBP/Glc complex and the unfolded protein. The limiting step of the unfolding-refolding process of the complex GGBP/Glc is the arrangement/de-arrangement of the configuration fit between the protein in the native state and the ligand. The rate of these processes increases/decreases with the increase/decrease of the denaturant concentration. Calcium depletion had a pronounced destabilizing effect on the structure of GGBP but did not affect the stability of GGBP/Glc complex. Unfolding of GGBP/Ca complex is reversible. Only incubation of the unfolded protein at high temperature leads to an irreversible process due to the aggregation of the protein.

This implies that bcl2mid is a good candidate for elucidating the mechanisms of structural conversion between different G-quadruplexes. We further discovered that the conversion between the monomer and dimer forms of bcl2mid does not occur at room temperature but is detected when heated above the melting point. In addition, the use of the lithium cation to keep the same ionic strength in a K(+) solution favors the formation of the bcl2mid dimer. We also found that the bcl2mid dimer is more stable than the monomer. However, after the bcl2mid monomer is formed in a K(+) solution, there is no appreciable structural conversion from the monomer to the dimer detected with addition of Li(+) at room temperature. Furthermore, the spectral changes of bcl2mid when transitioning from sodium form to potassium form take place upon K(+) titration. The absence of the dimer form for bcl2mid after the direct addition of 150 mM [K(+)] at room temperature suggests that the spectral changes are not due to rapid unfolding and refolding.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that hLIF is a pleiotropic cytokine with multiple effects on different types of cells and tissues. The optimal chemical synthesis of the hLIF gene has been previously reported to increase the expression of the recombinant inclusion body protein in E. coli. However, the required refolding step limits the recovery rate. In this report, a novel strategy was designed to produce a soluble recombinant human LIF (rhLIF) in the prokaryotic system in order to obtain higher yields of the bioactive protein with simpler steps. This optimal hLIF gene was cloned, and it successfully expressed the soluble recombinant protein in E. coli using the thioredoxin (Trx) protein as a fusion partner. A simple purification procedure is established to purify the recombinant fusion protein from the soluble supernatant of the lysed culture cells. This procedure yields up to 5 mg/L rhLIF with above 95? purity. The strategy allows the protease to release target cytokines without additional N-terminus amino acids, which is an important consideration for maintaining its bioactivity. Functional analysis of the purified rhLIF by murine myeloblastic leukemia M1 cell proliferation assay demonstrates biological activity that is similar and comparable to that of hLIF. These results present a sound strategy for the soluble production of rhLIF and other homologous tertiary structure cytokines consisting of four Î±-helices in a bundle for basic research, as well as clinical applications.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21342093 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Lin J, Liu J, Lu M, Deng S, Ma L</author>\n    <category>Protein Pept Lett</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21342093</guid>\n</item>	52	1301032482

Here, we present experiments, using bovine serum albumin (BSA), lysozyme (LYZ), and Î²-lactoglobulin (BLG) as model proteins, to show that arginine can enhance heat-induced aggregation of concentrated protein solutions, contrary to the conventional belief that arginine is a universal suppressor of aggregation. Results show that the enhancement in aggregation is caused only for BSA and BLG, but not for LYZ, indicating that arginine's preferential interactions with certain residues over others could determine the effect of the additive on aggregation. We use this previously unrecognized behavior of arginine, in combination with density functional theory calculations, to identify the molecular-level interactions of arginine with various residues that determine arginine's role as an enhancer or suppressor of aggregation of proteins. The experimental and computational results suggest that the guanidinium group of arginine promotes aggregation through the hydrogen-bond-based bridging interactions with the acidic residues of a protein, whereas the binding of the guanidinium group to aromatic residues (aggregation-prone) contributes to the stability and solubilization of the proteins. The approach, we describe here, can be used to select suitable additives to stabilize a protein solution at high concentrations based on an analysis of the amino acid content of the protein.

Significant progress has been made to elucidate the molecular pathways involved in this process, yet little is known about proteins counteracting these apoptotic pathways. It is established that heat shock proteins (HSPs) function as molecular helper proteins (chaperones) by preventing protein aggregation and facilitating refolding of dysfunctional proteins, critical to the survival of all organisms. Here, we investigated the role of HSP70 on photoreceptor survival after experimental retinal detachment (RD) in mice and rats. We found that HSP70 was up-regulated after RD and associated with phosphorylated Akt, thereby preventing its dephosphorylation and further activation of cell death pathways. Administration of quercetin, which inhibits HSP70 and suppresses Akt phosphorylation significantly increased photoreceptor apoptosis. Similarly, RD-induced photoreceptor apoptosis was augmented in mice carrying hypomorphic mutations of the genes encoding HSP70. On the other hand, administration of geranylgeranylacetone, which induces an increase in HSP70 significantly decreased photoreceptor apoptosis after RD through prolonged activation of Akt pathway. Thus, HSP70 may be a favorable potential target to increase photoreceptor cell survival after RD.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21356360 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Kayama M, Nakazawa T, Thanos A, Morizane Y, Murakami Y, Theodoropoulou S, Abe T, Vavvas D, Miller JW</author>\n    <category>Am J Pathol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21356360</guid>\n</item>	4	1301380610

We produced human S100A3 protein and its mutants in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. The purified wild-type S100A3 and the pseudo-citrullinated form (R51A) were crystallized using ammonium sulphate in N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine (Bicine) buffer; and, specifically for post-refolding treatment, with Ca(2+)/Zn(2+) supplementation. We identified two previously undocumented disulphide bridges in the crystal structure of properly-folded S100A3: one is between Cys30 in the N-terminal pseudo-EF-hand and Cys68 in the C-terminal EF-hand (SS1), and another attaches Cys99 located in the C-terminal coil structure to Cys81 in helix IV (SS2). Mutational disruption of SS1 (C30A+C68A) abolished the Ca(2+)-binding property of S100A3 and retarded citrullination of Arg51 by peptidylarginine deiminase type III (PAD3), while SS2 disruption inversely increased both Ca(2+)-affinity and PAD3 reactivity in vitro. Similar backbone structures of WT, R51A and C30A+C68A indicated that neither Arg51 conversion by PAD3 nor SS1 alter the overall dimer conformation. Comparative inspection of the atomic coordination refined to 2.15 - 1.40 Ã… resolutions show that SS1 renders the hinge region flexible and the helix III reorientation, those are essential for its Ca(2+)-binding properties, whereas SS2 structurally shelters Arg51 in the metal-free form. A model of the tetrahedral coordination of a Zn(2+) ion by (Cys)(3)His residues that is compatible with SS2 formation in S100A3 is proposed.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21377473 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Unno M, Kawasaki T, Takahara H, Heizmann CW, Kizawa K</author>\n    <category>J Mol Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21377473</guid>\n</item>	50	1301386899

Under multiple cellular stress conditions, p53 functions to block cell cycle progression transiently unless proper DNA repair occurs. Failure of DNA repair mechanisms leads to p53-mediated induction of cell death programs. p53 also induces permanent cell cycle arrest known as cellular senescence. During neoplastic progression, p53 is often mutated and fails to efficiently perform these functions. It has been observed that cancers carrying a wild-type p53 may also have disrupted downstream p53 regulatory signaling leading to disruption in p53 functions. Therefore, strategies to reactivate p53 provide an attractive approach for blocking tumor pathogenesis and its progression. p53 activation may also lead to regression of existing early neoplastic lesions and therefore may be important in developing cancer chemoprevention protocols. A large number of small molecules capable of reactivating p53 have been developed and some are progressing through clinical trials for prospective human applications. However, several questions remain to be answered at this stage. For example, it is not certain if pharmacological activation of p53 will restore all of its multifaceted biological responses, assuming that the targeted cell is not killed following p53 activation. It remains to be demonstrated whether the distinct biological effects regulated by specific post-translationally modified p53 can effectively be restored by refolding mutant p53. Mutant p53 can be classified as a loss-of-function or gain-of-function protein depending on the type of mutation. It is also unclear whether reactivation of mutant p53 has similar consequences in cells carrying gain-of-function and loss-of-function p53 mutants. This review provides a description of various pharmacological approaches tested to activate p53 (both wild-type and mutant) and to assess the effects of activated p53 on neoplastic progression.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21391904 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Athar M, Elmets CA, Kopelovich L</author>\n    <category>Curr Pharm Des</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21391904</guid>\n</item>	3	1301560604

This activity resides within the domain V of the main RNA component of the large subunit of the ribosome. It has been shown that two antiprion drugs 6-aminophenanthridine (6AP) and Guanabenz (GA) bind to the ribosomal RNA and inhibit specifically the protein folding activity of the ribosome. Here, we have characterized with biochemical experiments, the mode of inhibition of ribosome assisted protein folding by these two drugs using ribosomes or ribosomal components active in protein folding (referred to as 'ribosomal folding modulators or RFMs) from both bacteria Escherichia coli and yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and human carbonic anhydrase (HCA) as a sample protein. Our results indicate that 6AP and GA inhibit the protein folding activity of the ribosome by competition with the unfolded protein for binding to the ribosome. As a result, the yield of the refolded protein decreases, but the rate of its refolding remains unaffected. Further, 6AP- and GA-mediated inhibition of RFM mediated refolding can be reversed by the addition of RFMs in excess. We also demonstrate with delayed addition of the ribosome and the antiprion drugs that there is a short time-span in the range of seconds within which the ribosome interacts with the unfolded protein. Thus we conclude that the protein folding activity of the ribosome is conserved from bacteria to eukaryotes and most likely the substrate for RFMs is an early refolding state of the target protein.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21396977 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Reis SD, Pang Y, Vishnu N, Voisset C, Galons H, Blondel M, Sanyal S</author>\n    <category>Biochimie</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21396977</guid>\n</item>	83	1301577728

We use the principle of immobilization of histidine-tagged biopolymers at a Ni(II)-encoded Langmuir monolayer to study sequence-specific protein-protein interactions in an artificially crowded environment. The advantage of this technique lies in increasing the surface density of one of the interacting partners that allows us to study macromolecular interactions in a controlled crowded environment, but without compromising the speed of the reactions. We have taken advantage of this technique to follow the sequential assembly process of the multiprotein complex Escherichia coli RNA polymerase at the interface and also deciphered the role of one of the proteins, omega (Ï‰), in the assembly pathway. Our reconstitution studies indicate that in the absence of molecular chaperones or other cofactors, omega (Ï‰) plays a decisive role in refolding the largest protein beta prime (Î²') and its recruitment into the multimeric assembly to reconstitute an active RNA polymerase. It was also observed that the monolayer had the ability to distinguish between sequence-specific and -nonspecific interactions despite the immobilization of one of the biomacromolecules.

Therefore, the conversion between these off-pathway structures and the native correctly folded ones is the critical step in RNA folding. This process, referred to as RNA refolding, is slow and is represented by a transition state that has a characteristic high free-energy. Because this kinetically limiting process occurs in vivo, proteins (called RNA chaperones) have evolved which facilitate the (re)folding of RNA molecules. Here, we present an overview of how proteins interact with RNA molecules in order to achieve properly folded states. In this respect, the discrimination between static and transient interactions is crucial, as different proteins have evolved a multitude of mechanisms for RNA remodeling. For RNA chaperones that act in a sequence-unspecific manner and without the use of external sources of energy, such as ATP, transient RNA-protein interactions are at the basis of the mode of action. By presenting stretches of positively charged amino acids that are positioned in defined spatial configurations, RNA chaperones enable the RNA backbone, via transient electrostatic interactions, to sample a wider conformational space that opens the route for efficient refolding reactions.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21410645 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Doetsch M, Schroeder R, FÃ¼rtig B</author>\n    <category>FEBS J</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21410645</guid>\n</item>	28	1301577727

The DHFR structures are generally very similar except for the A-B loop region and part of helix B (residues 15-31) which could not be directly detected for L. casei apo DHFR because of line-broadening from exchange between folded and unfolded forms. Thermodynamic and NMR measurements suggested that a significant but not dominant contribution to the cooperativity comes from refolding of apo DHFR on binding the first ligand (up to -0.7 kcals mol-1 estimated for A-B loop refolding). Comparisons of Cï¡-Cï¡ distance differences and domain rotation angles between apo DHFR and its complexes indicated that generally similar conformational changes involving domain movements accompany formation of the binary complexes with either TMP or NADPH, and that the binary structures are approaching that of the ternary complex as would be expected for positive cooperativity. These favorable ligand-induced structural changes upon binding the first ligand will also contribute significantly to the cooperative binding. A further substantial contribution to cooperative binding results from the proximity of the bound ligands in the ternary complex: this reduces the solvent accessible area of the ligand and provides a favorable entropic hydrophobic contribution (up to -1.4 kcal mol-1).</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21410224 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Feeney J, Birdsall B, Kovalevskaya NV, Smurnyy YD, Navarro-Peran EM, Polshakov VI</author>\n    <category>Biochemistry</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21410224</guid>\n</item>	21	1301577727

Solid-phase refolding of K6UbGLP-1 inclusion body using a cation exchanger of the SP Sepharose FF led to a refolding yield over 90 % even at 5.2 mg protein/mL resin. On-column cleavage of the refolded K6UbGLP-1 with ubiquitin-specific protease 1 gave an authentic form of GLP-1. Instrumental analyses using mass spectrometry and reverse-phase HPLC showed that the recombinant GLP-1 released from K6UbGLP-1 was identical to the standard GLP-1.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21421051 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Kim SG, Shin SY, Park YC, Shin CS, Seo JH</author>\n    <category>Protein Expr Purif</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21421051</guid>\n</item>	44	1301560604

During the refolding step, misfolded proteins such as disulfide scrambled forms can be formed, and purification steps are utilized to remove these product-related impurities to produce highly purified therapeutic proteins. A variety of analytical methods are commonly used to monitor protein variants throughout the purification process. CE based techniques are gaining popularity for such applications. In this work, we utilized a non-reduced capillary electrophoresis - sodium dodecyl sulfate (nrCE-SDS) method for the analysis of disulfide scrambled forms in a fusion protein. Under denatured non-reduced conditions, an extra post-shoulder peak was observed at all purification steps. Detailed characterization revealed that the peak was related to the disulfide scrambled forms, and was isobaric with the correctly folded product. Additionally, when SDS-PAGE was used during the CE-SDS peak characterization, we observed that the migration order of scrambled forms is reversed on CE-SDS vs. SDS-PAGE. This illustrates the importance of establishing proper correlation of these two techniques when they are used interchangeably to guide the purification process and to characterize proteins.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21420378 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Hapuarachchi S, Fodor S, Apostol I, Huang G</author>\n    <category>Anal Biochem</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21420378</guid>\n</item>	0	1301560604

A prominent feature of stressed cells is the increased synthesis of heat shock proteins (Hsps) that aid in the refolding of misfolded peptides and restrain protein aggregation. Transcriptional activation of the heat shock response is orchestrated by heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), which rapidly translocates to hsp genes and induces their expression. Although the role of HSF1 in protecting cells and organisms against severe stress insults is well established, many aspects of how HSF1 senses qualitatively and quantitatively different forms of stresses have remained poorly understood. Moreover, recent discoveries that HSF1 controls life span have prompted new ways of thinking about an old transcription factor. Here, we review the established role of HSF1 in counteracting cell stress and prospect the role of HSF1 as a regulator of disease states and aging.

HÎ³D-Crys exhibits two homologous crystallin domains, each containing two Greek key motifs with eight Î²-strands. Six aromatic pairs (four Tyr/Tyr, one Tyr/Phe and one Phe/Phe) are present in the Î²-hairpin sequences of the Greek keys. Ultraviolet damage to the aromatic residues in lens crystallins may contribute to the genesis of cataract. Mutant proteins with these aromatic residues substituted with alanines were constructed and expressed in E. coli. All mutant proteins except F115A and F117A had lower thermal stability than the WT protein. In equilibrium experiments in guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl), all mutant proteins had lower thermodynamic stability than the WT protein. N-terminal domain (N-td) substitutions shifted the N-td transition to lower GuHCl concentration, but the C-terminal domain (C-td) transition remained unaffected. C-td substitutions led to a more cooperative unfolding/refolding process, with both the N-td and C-td transitions shifted to lower GuHCl concentration. The aromatic pairs conserved for each Greek key motif (Greek key pairs) had larger contributions to both thermal stability and thermodynamic stability than the other pairs. Aromatic-aromatic interaction was estimated as 1.5-2.0 kcal/mol. In kinetic experiments, N-td substitutions accelerated the early phase of unfolding, while C-td substitutions accelerated the late phase, suggesting independent domain unfolding. Only substitutions of the second Greek key pair of each crystallin domain slowed refolding. The second Greek keys may provide nucleation sites during the folding of the double-Greek-key crystallin domains.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21432932 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Kong F, King J</author>\n    <category>Protein Sci</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21432932</guid>\n</item>	41	1301553440

Although AMEL has been sequenced in numerous mammalian lineages, the only reported strepsirrhine AMEL sequences are those of the ring-tailed lemur and galago, which contain a set of additional proline-rich tandem repeats absent in all other primates species analyzed to date, but present in some non-primate mammals. Here, we first determined that these repeats are present in AMEL from three additional lemur species and thus are likely to be widespread throughout this group. To evaluate the functional relevance of these repeats in strepsirrhines, we engineered a mutated murine amelogenin sequence containing a similar proline-rich sequence to that of Lemur catta. In the monomeric form, the MQP insertions had no influence on the secondary structure or refolding properties, whereas in the assembled form, the insertions increased the hydrodynamic radii.

In this study, two kinds of fluobody, in which the PL-scFv was fused at the N-terminus (N-fluobody) or C-terminus of AcGFP (C-fluobody), were expressed in silkworm larvae for comparative purposes. Interestingly, both fluobodies expressed in the BmNPV bacmid DNA system retained both of their original functions as an AcGFP and a PL-scFv, although the functions of the N-fluobody were found to be inferior to those of C-fluobody when they were expressed in Escherichia coli. Moreover, an improvement in the limit of quantification for PL measurement was observed in FLISA (24 ng mL(-1)) compared with conventional ELISA (0.2 Âµg mL(-1)). Since both the C-fluobody and N-fluobody are useful probes for FLISA and the time-, cost-consuming refolding step required in the conventional bacterial expression system can be avoided when they are expressed in the BmNPV bacmid DNA system, the silkworm expression system is useful for expressing fluobodies when developing FLISA.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21442099 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Sakamoto S, Pongkitwitoon B, Sasaki-Tabata K, Putalun W, Maenaka K, Tanaka H, Morimoto S</author>\n    <category>Analyst</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21442099</guid>\n</item>	7	1301573119

Bacteria have therefore evolved powerful quality control networks consisting of chaperones and proteases that cooperate to monitor the folding states of proteins and to remove misfolded conformers through either refolding or degradation. The levels of the quality control components are adjusted to the folding state of the cellular proteome through the induction of compartment specific stress responses. In addition, the activities of several quality control components are directly controlled by these stresses, allowing for fast activation. Severe stress can, however, overcome the protective function of the proteostasis network leading to the formation of protein aggregates, which are sequestered at the cell poles. Protein aggregates are either solubilized by AAA+ chaperones or eliminated through cell division, allowing for the generation of damage-free daughter cells.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21441580 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Mogk A, Huber D, Bukau B</author>\n    <category>Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21441580</guid>\n</item>	0	1301573119

Here we show that when urea-denatured SAA2.2 is dialyzed into buffer (pH 8.0, 4Â°C), it refolds mostly into an octameric species. The octamer transitions to the hexameric structure upon incubation from days to weeks at 4Â°C, depending on the SAA2.2 concentration. Thermal denaturation of the octamer and hexamer monitored by circular dichroism showed that the octamer is âˆ¼10Â°C less stable, with a denaturation mid point of âˆ¼22Â°C. Thus, SAA2.2 becomes kinetically trapped by refolding into a less stable, but more kinetically accessible octameric species. The ability of SAA2.2 to form different oligomeric species in vitro along with its marginal stability, suggest that the structure of SAA might be modulated in vivo to form different biologically relevant species.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21439938 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Wang Y, Srinivasan S, Ye Z, Javier Aguilera J, Lopez MM, ColÃ³n W</author>\n    <category>Biochem Biophys Res Commun</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21439938</guid>\n</item>	10	1301573119

Conformational rearrangement of Env upon binding to the host CD4 receptor and chemokine coreceptor drives membrane fusion. We elucidated the quaternary arrangement of the soluble Env trimeric immunogen o-gp140Î”V2TV1, in both its native (unliganded) and CD4-induced (liganded) states by cryoelectron microscopy and molecular modeling. The liganded conformation was elicited by binding gp140 to the synthetic CD4-mimicking miniprotein CD4m. Upon CD4m binding, an outward domain shift of the three gp120 subunits diminishes gp120-gp41 interactions, whereas a "flat open" concave trimer apex is observed consequent to gp120 tilting away from threefold axis, likely juxtaposing the fusion peptide with the host membrane. Additional features observed in the liganded conformation include rotations of individual gp120 subunits that may release gp41 for N- and C-helix refolding and also may lead to optimal exposure of the elicited coreceptor binding site. Such quaternary arrangements of gp140 lead to the metastable liganded conformation, with putative locations of exposed epitopes contributing to a description of sequential events occurring prior to membrane fusion. Our observations imply a mechanism whereby a soluble Env trimeric construct, as opposed to trimers extracted from virions, may better expose crucial epitopes such as the CD4 binding site and V3, as well as epitopes in the vicinity of gp41, subsequent to conjugation with CD4m. Structural features gleaned from our studies should aid the design of Env-based immunogens for inducement of potent broadly neutralizing antibodies against exposed conformational epitopes.</p>\n        <p>PMID: 21444771 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ]]></description>\n    <author> Moscoso CG, Sun Y, Poon S, Xing L, Kan E, Martin L, Green D, Lin F, Vahlne AG, Barnett S, Srivastava I, Cheng RH</author>\n    <category>Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A</category>\n    <guid isPermaLink="false">PubMed:21444771</guid>\n</item>	13	1301571829
