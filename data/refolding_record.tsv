Oxidation was carried out by sparging air at a flow rate of 0.1 L/min in identical 1 L Erlenmeyer flasks and sparging systems, thus ensuring reproducibility of the oxidation conditions.\n  Refolding of recombinant sulfonated prochymosin was performed as follows: The inclusion bodies were resuspended in 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 10 M urea, 0.3 M Na2SO3, and incubated at 37degC for 30 min. Sulfonation was completed by the addition of 20 mM 2-nitro-thiosulfobenzoate final concentration, followed by incubation of the solution for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. The reaction was quenched by extensive dialysis of the sulfonated recombinant prochymosin against 0.7% (v/v) acetic acid at 4degC to minimize unwanted disulfide shuffling. Sulfonated recombinant prochymosin was found to be insoluble in the absence of the denaturant. The protein precipitate was recovered by centrifugation at 10,000g for 20 min at 4degC and solubilized in 50 mM KH2PO4 (pH 10.7), urea 8 M. Refolding was started by diluting 40 ml of the unfolded protein solution (20  mg/ml) in 1 L of degassed renaturation buffer containing 50 mM KH2PO4 (pH 10.7), 1 mM EDTA, DTT (1–10 mM), and incubated at selected temperatures.			67%	1	2	50 ml of 10 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100	4	0.8mg.ml	Escherichia coli	BL21	pET22b	37	6h	1mM	yes	600	0.7	1	95% prochymosin, as judged by SDS?PAGE	1147	4	49	2003-11-20	2006-03-08	soluble	1	2214	1	2	n	n	600	0.7	Cells were grown in Luria–Bertani medium containing ampicillin (100 microg/ml) at 37degC to an optical density of 0.7 at 600 nm.

Lysates were centrifuged at 20,000g to collect the inclusion bodies. Pellets were resuspended and the process of sonication and centrifugation was repeated twice more to release trapped proteins. Pellets were finally resuspended in solubilization buffer and incubated on ice for 2–3h with continuous stirring to solubilize proteins. Any remaining insoluble material was removed by centrifuging at 39,000g for 20 min. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45micron membrane before column purification. The protein was then purified under denaturing conditions using a Ni-NTA column, then refolded by dialysis against refolding buffer.\n	The final product contains contaminants originating from autolytic cleavage.\nOther refolding methods and conditions trialled - see paper for more details.			4	2	5mM imidazole, 500mM NaCl, 20mM TrisHCl pH 7.9	27		Escherichia coli	HMS174(DE3)	pET28a	37	3h	0.1mM	no	600	0.6	2		1149	4	50	2003-11-20	2006-03-08	insoluble	1	2162	2	2	n	n	600	0.6	Cells in Terrific Broth containing potassium phosphates plus 50 mg/ml kanamycin were grown until OD600 reached 0.6.

The solubilized inclusion bodies were incubated for 30 min at 45degC to ensure complete reduction\nand sulfonation of cysteine residues. The mixture was subsequently passed through a BioGel P6 column (2 x 3cm, Bio-Rad) previously equilibrated in buffer A (2 M guanidinium hydrochloride; 1 mM EDTA; 50 mM Tris?HCl, pH 8.0) to separate the modified protein from excess NTSB and to exchange the buffer.  The protein peak, eluted in a total volume of approx. 0.8ml, served as the starting material for the refolding process. Columns (138 cm) packed with the BioGel P6 resin were equilibrated with 3 column vol of buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 1 mM EDTA), followed by 1 column vol of buffer C (buffer B containing 2 mM oxidized glutathione; 4 mM reduced glutathione; 4 mM n-dodecyl-b-D-maltoside).

The washed cells were disrupted by ultrasonic disintegrator (model 550, Fisher Scientific) operated for 10 cycles at 7.5 intensity. EGF IB pellets were obtained by centrifuging the cell lysate at 5600 g for 30 min, and then washed by wash buffer B (10 mM EDTA/0.2 M Na2HPO4, pH 7.5). SDS was used to dissolve the IB as described previously by Kim et al. [7].

The cleavage of the signal peptide in the presence of 1.5M urea was vital - cleavage of the peptide in lower concentrations of urea resulted in precipitation.			50%	1	2	50mM Tris-HCl, 2mM EDTA, pH 8.0	1		Escherichia coli	BL21	pET23a	37	2-3h	0	no tag	0		1	single band on SDS gel	1335	4	18	2003-12-09	2007-10-03	insoluble	1	1753	2	1	n	n			unknown	n/a	NULL	1350

The high concentration of reducing agent\npresent in this buffer ensures that proteins are homogeneously reduced and unfolded. The denaturing solution was pipetted up and down to ensure complete solubilization of the inclusion bodies, followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 10000 rpm at 4°C in the Sorvall RC 5C-Plus centrifuge to separate the solubilized\ndenatured protein from cell debris. The cleared\nsupernatant was collected and the protein concentration determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). If necessary more denaturing solution was added to achieve a final protein concentration of around 10?0 mg/ml. The solution of unfolded protein can be kept for a few\ndays at 4°C, and it was found best to leave the solution a few hours or overnight before use, to allow for complete denaturation.\nPurification under denaturing conditions. As an\ninitial purification step, gel filtration using Superdex 200 prep grade 16/60 column (Pharmacia), was performed under denaturing conditions using FPLC (Pharmacia) controlled manually or through the program UNICORN. The column was equilibrated overnightwith denaturing buffer, plus 5 mM DTT and no protease inhibitors. Since the maximum sample capacity\nfor this size of column is 5 ml, it was necessary to split the sample over two or more runs and pool the fractions containing Tc1A. The column flow rate was 0.6 ml/min, and 1.8-ml fractions were collected from the second chromatographic peak that appeared after approximately 51.6 ml of flowthrough (approx. 1 h 30 min). Occasionally, the samples to be pooled together were checked by SDS?PAGE and stained with Coomassie\nblue (R-250) (Sigma). The amount of sample\nanalyzed by SDS?PAGE was diluted four times in loading buffer (5 ml sample/20 ml loading buffer) to minimize the distortion of the bands due to the large amount of salt present in the samples. Fractions were selected according to their purity, avoiding those with low-molecular-weight contaminants. The pooled protein was adjusted with denaturing buffer to #2 mg/ml (50 ml final volume). \nRefolding by gel filtration chromatography. Five\nmilliliters of denatured protein (2 mg/ml) was loaded on to a second Superdex 200 prep grade 16/60 column (Pharmacia), this time equilibrated with refolding buffer (10% glycerol, 25 mM phosphate buffer, pH 5.5, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT) with a flow\nrate of 0.6 ml/min. Fractions of 3 ml were collected. The chromatographic pattern of Tc1A refolding is always highly repetitive (Fig. 2). The peak that belongs to soluble and active protein appeared after approximately 72 ml (approx. 2 h). The purity of the fractions was checked by SDS?PAGE as described above. Multiple\nloadings of 5 ml were necessary and the best\nfractions from each run were pooled together (approx. 9?2 ml of sample collected per run). Total protein concentration was ;0.5 mg/ml, calculated by the Bradford\nassay or by using UV, knowing that the e280 for\nTc1A is 76,200 (as calculated by the program PHD-sec (27)). The refolded protein at this stage shows a high degree of purity (around 95%), but there remain some contaminants of slightly lower molecular weight which are not resolved by gel filtration, so after refolding, an ion-exchange purification step was added.			14mg/L culture	3	1	0.5% NP-40, 1mM EDTA, 3M urea	1	2mg/ml	Escherichia coli	BL21	pET3c	37	3h	0	yes	0		1		1337	4	21	2003-12-09	2007-10-03	insoluble	1	2221	2	1	n	n			unknown	n/a	NULL	1352

Centrifugation for 15 min at 15000g removed 1 g of urea-insoluble material.\nThe solubilized material was loaded onto a 30-mL QSepharose column which had been equilibrated with solubilization buffer. The column was washed with 200 mL of solubilization buffer (0.35 ` i n ) followed by elution with a 300-mL linear gradient of 0-250 mM NaCl in solubilization\nbuffer. Apo-EryK began to elute at 50 mM NaCl\nand continued for 10 7-mL fractions. These fractions were pooled and diluted 4-fold with 50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, to yield a 2.5 mg/mL protein solution (Bradford assay). Refolding of apo-EryK was achieved by dividing this 350- mL solution equally among five 4 x 45 cm dialysis\nmembranes (Spectropor; MW cutoff, 6000-8000; 5 mL/cm capacity) and dialyzing overnight at 4 `C against 3.5 L of 50 mM Tris-HC1, pH 7.5, sparged continuously with argon.

The process was continued with 1 CV of 100% of UB, 1.5 CV of a gradient from 100% UB to 100% RB, and 9 CV of 100% RB at the end of the first cycle. During the second cycle the percentage of UB concentration was decreased from 100 to 96%, thus, the UB percentage difference between cycles was 4%.\nThe percentage of UB reached 28% in cycle 19 and was followed by 25% UB in cycle 20, 20% UB in cycle 21, 15% UB in cycle 22, and 10% UB in cycle 23. Renatured protein was then eluted with buffer E at a flow rate of\n1 ml/min.			0.4mg/L culture	4	2	unknown	5		Escherichia coli	BL21	pRSET A	30	3h	0	no	0		2		1357	4	96	2004-01-06	2007-10-03	partial	1	2086	1	1	n	n			unknown	n/a	NULL	1369

The inclusion body pellet obtained was washed with 50 m m Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 5 m m EDTA and 2% deoxycholate and the r-bmZPC inclusion bodies were purified as described previously [ 14]. The purified inclusion bodies were solubilized in 100 m m Tris/HCl buffer at different pH values (4-12). Solubilization of r-bmZPC from inclusion bodies was further optimized by adding different concentrations of urea (2-8 m). Fixed amounts of inclusion bodies (2 mg·mL 1) in the above buffers were left at room temperature for 30 min. After incubation, the suspensions were centrifuged at 8000  g  for 10 min and the protein content of the supernatants and pellets were estimated using bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) reagents (Pierce, IL, USA).\nPurified r-bmZPC inclusion bodies were solubilized in optimized conditions comprising 100 m m Tris buffer (pH 12) containing 2 m urea for 30 min at room temperature. The pH of the solubilized protein was brought down to 8.5 by adding 1 m HCl followed by extensive dialysis at 4 °C against renaturation buffer (20 m m Tris buffer, pH 8.5, containing 1 m m EDTA, 1 m m reduced glutathione, 0.1 m m oxidized glutathione and 10% sucrose).

The cultures were induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl- b-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) and grown for an additional 2 h at the same temperature. The bacteria were recovered by centrifugation, resuspended in native buffer (Na2HPO4 50 mM, NaCl 300 mM, pH 8), and lysed by freezing?defrosting cycles and sonication.\nThe lysate was centrifuged at 1000g for 20 min and the pellet was resuspended in 10 vol of native buffer, washed, and centrifuged twice. The final pellet was resuspended in 10 vol of buffer A (8 M urea, 10 mM Tris, 100 mM Na2HPO4, 10 mM2-mercaptoethanol, pH 8), left for 1 h at room temperature and finally centrifuged for 1 h at 10,000g. The supernatant was mixed with the Ni?NTA resin (Qiagen), which had been previously equilibrated with buffer A (6 mg or more of TcP0 was added for each ml of resin). The mixture was incubated with slow agitation for 1 h at room temperature and poured into the column. The flowthrough was collected and the column subsequently washed four times with 3 vol of buffer A followed by four washes\nwith 3 vol of buffer B (8 M urea, 10 mM Tris, 100\nmM Na2HPO4, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.3).

(1989). Cells lysis was done with lyzosyme (Sigma), and liberated DNA/RNA was digested with DNase I (Sigma) and RNAse A (Sigma). Inclusion bodies were collected by centrifugation at 17,000g for 10 min at 4°C and washed in PBS supplemented with 0.5 % (v/v) NP-40 (Sigma) and 0.1 % (w/v) deoxycholic acid (Sigma) followed by washing in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, and 100 mM NaCl. Washed inclusion bodies were solubilized in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 8 M urea (200 mL for each 100 g of wet cell paste). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 17,000g for 15 min at 4°C. Supernatants were pooled and successively filtered through 8-, 3-, 1.2-, and 0.45-µm filters and stored at -20°C until further processing.\nChromatographic separations were performed at 12°C on a ÄKTA prime workstation (Amersham Biosciences), using a flow rate of 60 mL/h. All chromatographic media and columns were from Amersham Biosciences, Sweden, including 1 mL HiTrap columns for screening experiments. The purification was monitored by SDS-PAGE and bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce). Urea decomposition leads to the generation of cyanate. To minimize the concentration of cyanate in urea-containing buffers, all solution were made freshly and used immediately, and the primary amine, Tris, was included as cyanate scavenger (Wingfield 2002). A preparation of solubilized inclusion bodies was applied to a Q Sepharose Fast Flow column (2.6 x 65 cm) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 8 M urea (Merck; loading buffer). Unbound material was washed off with 2 column volumes (CV) of loading buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear 0 to 1 M NaCl gradient (5 CV). Fractions containing functional MHC-I heavy chain were pooled. Functional pools from Q Sepharose Fast Flow fractionation were adjusted to 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 8 M urea, and ammonium sulfate (Sigma) was added to 20% (w/v) saturation. The solution was stirred at room temperature for 30 min, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 17,000g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-µm filter and applied to a phenyl Sepharose High Performance column (2.6 x 70 cm), equilibrated with 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 8 M urea, and 20% ammonium sulfate. Unbound proteins were washed off with 1.5 CV of the same buffer. Bound proteins were eluted from the column with a linear 20% to 0% ammonium sulfate gradient (5 CV). Prior to the subsequent size exclusion chromatography step, fractions were pooled and concentrated on a 10-kD nominal-molecular-weight-limit filter (Millipore) in a stirred nitrogen pressure cell (Amicon) to a final volume of 15 mL. Size exclusion chromatography was done on two Sephacryl 200-HR or two Sephacryl 400-HR columns (2.6 x 100 cm) connected in series. Columns were equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 8 M urea, or 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. Purified heavy chains were pooled, aliquoted, and stored at -20°C until further analysis.\nRefolding conditions reported by Pedersen et al. (2001) for MHC-I heavy chain were used. Purified MHC-I heavy chain samples were refolded by 100-fold dilution in the presence of excess human ?m (3 µM) and radiolabeled peptide (1 to 3 nM, 15,000 cpm/sample) for 24 h at 18°C in a total reaction volume of 100 µL per sample. The refolding buffer was 100 mM Tris-maleate buffer (pH 6.6) in PBS supplemented with 1 mg/mL pluronic copolymer Lutrol F-68 (BASF). The final concentration of urea after dilution was 80 mM. The recombinant human ?m was produced in our laboratory from E. coli fermentations (Pedersen et al. 2001). Binding of peptide to MHC-I heavy chains were measured by Sephadex G-50 spun column chromatography (Buus et al. 1995). The radioactivity of the excluded `void` volume, containing formed MHC-I complexes, and of the retained volume, containing unbound peptide, was measured by gamma spectrometry (Packard Instruments). Peptide binding values were calculated by dividing excluded radioactivity with the total amount of radioactivity offered. Mean peptide binding values were obtained from duplicate spun column chromatography runs and expressed in percent.\nPeptides were purchased from Schaefer-N, purified to homogeneity by reverse-phase HPLC chromatography, lyophilized, and stored at -20°C. All preparations were quantified by using the BCA assay. Radiolabeling was done with 125Iodine (Amersham Biosciences). Peptides used for refolding of MHC-I heavy chains, and biochemical binding assays had the following sequences (in single letter code): FLPSDYFPSV for HLA-A*0201, KLFPPLYLR for HLA-A*1101, and SDYEGRLI (Influenza NP peptide50?7) for H2-Kk (des cys).			>30 mg / L media	9	1	PBS supplemented with 0.5 % (v/v) NP-40 (Sigma) and 0.1 % (w/v) deoxycholic acid (Sigma)	1		Escherichia coli	BL21	pET28a+	42	3h	0	no tag	0		1	95%	1363	4	121	2004-01-12	2007-10-03	insoluble	1	2088	2	1	n	n			unknown	n/a	NULL	1375

The inclusionbodies were then washed at least 3 times in wash buffer before being dissolved in solubilization buffer. The protein preparation was then gel filtrated into a loading buffer containing 8M urea, 0.5M NaCl, 50mM TrisHCl, pH 8.0, 5mM 2-mercaptoethanol, before it was batch-mixed with Ni-NTA agarose for 5min and packed into a column. The protein was was purified by washing with 1 column volume of loading buffer followed by 1 column volume of 6M GdnHCl, 50mM TrisHCl, 5mM 2-mercaptoethanol and then loading buffer again until a stable baseline was reached. The column was then washed with a buffer containing 8M urea, 0.5M NaCl, 50mM TrisHCl, pH 8.0, 3mM reduced glutathione. \nThe protein was then refolded in a cyclic fashion over a 24h period. Each cycle started with 45min of renaturation in refolding buffer followed by a step of denaturing and reducing conditions for 6 min, followed by a linear gradient of 8min from denaturation to renaturation and the start of the next cycle. The buffer applied in the denaturing phases was a mixed from the refolding buffer and a denaturation buffer containing 6M urea, 0.5M NaCl, 50mM TrisHCl, pH 8.0, 3mM glutathione. The percentage of denaturation buffer was decreased in steps from 100% in cycle 1 to 35% in cycle 23 before the procedure completed  with 45min renaturation. The refolding was performed at 2ml/min flow rate and at 10degC.

The cells were harvested and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Following sonication, the solution was centrifuged at 12000rpm for 60min at 4degC. The pellet was then solubilized in solubilization buffer overnight at 4degC. The mixture was then centrifuged (12000rpm) and the supernatant was subjected to a Sephacryl S-200 column in 100mM TrisHCl (pH 8.0), 6M GdnHCl, 200mM NaCl.\nThe purified protein was then reduced prior to refolding by incubation with 100mM TrisHCl (pH 8.0), 6M GdnHCl, 200mM NaCl and 10mM 2-mercaptoethanol for at least 30min at room temperature. The 2-mercaptoethanol was then removed by dialysis against 100mM TrisHCl (pH 8.0), 6M GdnHCl, 200mM NaCl. GdnHCl was then diluted by dialysis against refolding buffer containing 3M GdnHCl, followed by further step-wise dialyses against refolding buffer containing decreasing concentrations of GdnHCl (2,1,0.5,0M). Each dialysis step was performed overnight. \nA mixed disulfide derivative of the reduced and denatured inclusion bodies was formed by dialysis against 100mM TrisHCl (pH 8.0), 200mM NaCl, 0.375mM oxidized glutathione (50x molar excess of refolding protein) at certain GdnHCl concentrations (3-0.5M). In some experiments 2-mercaptoethanol (50x molar excess of protein) was added to the mixture at certain GdnHCl stages.\nThe refolded protein was centrifuged (10000rpm x 15min) and the supernatant was loaded onto a HEL-sepharose column, comprising about 1-mg HEL/ml gel bound to CNBr-activated-Sepharose 4B, which had been preequilibrated with PBS.

The washed cell pellets were resuspended thoroughly in PBS buffer and disrupted by sonication using a sonicator (Model XL 2020, 419A microtipprobe, Misonix Inc., NY, USA) at a setting of 3. The sonicator was programmed to provide 10 s pulses with 5 s pause for a total period of 30 min. The disrupting pellets were washed with 50 ml PBS buffer containing 3 M urea to remove cell debris contaminants and were further centrifuged at 17,500xg for 30 min to isolate the inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were completely soluble in 50 ml PBS buffer (pH 12) containing 5 M urea at room temperature and the solubilized solution was clarified by centrifugation at 17,500xg for 30 min at 4degC. Refolding was initiated by diluting the solubilized protein in PBS buffer and the solution was then incubated at 4degC for 36 h. The refolded protein was centrifuged at 17,500xg for 30 min to remove any insoluble material. The supernatant fraction was collated and concentration by centrifugation using a type YM3 ultrafiltration membrane (molecular weight cutoff, 3000; Millipore, MA, USA) and then loaded to bind with the Ni-NTA gel (Qiagen). The gel was washed with 30 mM imidazole and eluted with 250 mM imidazole.

The initial work volume was 1.30 l of modified R-medium, containing citric acid (3g/L), KH2PO4 (6.75g/L), (NH4)2SO4 (5g/L), Na2HPO4.12H2O (3g/L), MgCl2 (1.5g/L), NH4Cl (0.1g/L), glucose (20g/L), yeast extract (20g/L), N-Z-Amine AS (30g/L) and 6ml/L of a trace metal solution. The composition of trace metal solution that contains (per ml of 5M HCl) FeSO4.7H2O 10mg, ZnSO4.7H2O 2.25mg, CaCl2.2H2O 1.35mg, MnSO4.5H2O 0.5mg, CuSO4.5H2O 1mg, AlCl.6H2O 0.3mg, (NH4)6Mo7O24.4H2O 0.1mg, H3BO3 0.2mg, and thiamine–HCl 2mg. Glucose was sterilized separately and trace metal solution was sterilized by filtration. The entire content of seed culture (7.69% v/v) was inoculated. The agitation speed and flow rate of aeration was set at 1000 rpm and 3L/min. The pH was kept at 7.0 by adding 28% (v/v) ammonium water. The dissolved oxygen concentration was maintained above 20% of air saturation by increasing the percentage of pure oxygen using a gas mixer. A nutrient feeding solution was added by using the pH-stat feeding strategy. The nutrient solution contained glucose 750g/L, yeast extract 50g/L, N-Z-Amine AS 75g/L, MgSO4.7H2O 20g/L, citric acid 3g/L, KH2PO4 6.75g/L, (NH4)2SO4 5g/L, Na2HPO4.12H2O 3g/L, MgCl2 5g/L, NH4Cl 0.1g/L. When the pH rose to a value greater than the set point (pH 7.0) by 0.1U due to the depletion of glucose, the nutrient feeding solution was automatically added to increase the glucose concentration in the culture broth. Expression of the igf-2 gene was induced by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 0.06 mM.	n/a		1528

The pellet was thawed on ice for 1 hour and then 10 µg/ml DNAse and 20 mM MgSO4 (final concentration) were added to the cell suspension for 30 min. Cells were disrupted by ultrasonication (10 times with a 15s cycle) using a Branson Sonifier 450. Inclusions bodies were separated from the cell extract by centrifugation at 17000 g for 30 min. The pellet was then washed with 10 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl, sonicated (4 times with a 15s cycle) and collected by centrifugation at 17000 g for 20 min, this procedure was repeated three times. Inclusions bodies were solubilized by stirring at 4°C overnight in a 40 ml solution containing 10 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. The solubilized protein was clarified from insoluble material at 4°C by centrifugation at 17000 g for 15 min. The supernatant was loaded (3 ml/min) onto a Ni2+-agarose column (1 ml resin for 5 mg of recombinant protein) previously equilibrated with buffer A (10 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole and 8 M urea). The column was then washed using 5 column volumes of 5% and 10% of buffer B (buffer A+500 mM imidazole). Enzyme was eluted with 50% of buffer B; fractions of eluted peaks containing purified Rv1399c were analyzed by SDS–PAGE, pooled and concentrated up to 4-5 mg/ml using an Amicon cell. \n\nRefolding:\nPurified Rv1399c was refolded by a dilution method consisting of diluting the concentrated protein in buffers with different pH and various compositions. The refolding conditions were determined by a refolding method based on the measurement of the turbidity at 340 nm using a 96-well plate. The final refolding conditions consisted of diluting Rv1399c 20 fold in 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 7, at 4°C for two days. Rv1399c was concentrated up to 2-3 mg/ml and traces of urea and imidazole were removed using a desalting column (HiPrepTM 26/10, Amersham Biosciences). Rv1399c was then concentrated up to 3 mg/ml and stored overnight at –20°C, and after thawing, the “active” refolded material was recovered by centrifugation at 17000 g for 15 min. Rv1399c is stable in the refolding buffer for at least 1 month at 4°C and can be stored at –20°C for several months. 		esterase	50%	6	2	10 mM   Tris-HCl, pH8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10mM Imidazole and 8M Urea	1	3mg/ml	Escherichia coli	BL21	pDest17OI	37	ON	0	yes	0		2	98%	1434	145	239	2005-08-25	2007-10-05	insoluble	1	1810	2	1	n	n			unknown	n/a	NULL	1542

Fresh Ni2+-NTA resin (1 ml) was washed in solubilisation buffer before being added to solubilised inclusion bodies (10 mg protein per ml resin).  The slurry was stirred gently at room temperature for 30 min and then packed into a chromatography column.  The column was washed at room temperature with 10 volumes of solubilisation buffer followed by 10 volumes of solubilisation buffer containing 50 mM imidazole, in order to remove contaminating proteins.

Fresh Luria broth containing kanamycin (25 µg/ml) was inoculated with the overnight culture at a dilution of 1:50 and cultured at 37 °C to an A600 nm of 0.6-0.8. Expression of PvRII was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio--galactopyranoside to the culture at a final concentration of 1 mM. Induced cultures were allowed to grow for 4 h at 37 °C. \n\nIsolation of Inclusion Bodies and Purification of Recombinant PvRII by Metal Affinity Chromatography under Denaturing Conditions-- AFter induction, E. coli cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed in chilled wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl), resuspended in chilled lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mM benzamidine-HCl, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 200 µg/ml lysozyme), and lysed by sonication. Inclusion bodies were collected by centrifugation of lysed cells at 4 °C, solubilized in 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 6 M guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl), and treated with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for 2 h at 37 °C. After removal of DTT by ultrafiltration using filters with 10-kDa cutoff, recombinant PvRII was purified from solubilized inclusion bodies by metal affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions using a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid column as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen). Solubilized inclusion bodies were loaded on a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid column previously equilibrated with equilibration buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaH2PO4, 6 M GdnHCl). The column was washed with equilibration buffer at pH 6.3, and bound protein was eluted using a pH gradient starting at pH 6.3 and ending at pH 4.3. The final concentration of the purified protein was adjusted to ~4.5 mg/ml with equilibration buffer. \n\nRefolding PvRII by Rapid Dilution-- Purified PvRII was refolded by 100-fold dilution in refolding buffer containing 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 1 mM reduced glutathione, 0.1 mM oxidized glutathione, 1 M urea, and 0.5 M arginine so that the final protein concentration was ~45 µg/ml. Refolding was allowed to proceed at 10 °C for 36 h with stirring. At the end of 36 h, the refolding solution was dialyzed for 48 h against dialysis buffer (50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 1 M urea) to remove arginine before proceeding with purification by ion-exchange chromatography. \n\nPurification of Refolded PvRII by Ion Exchange and Gel Filtration Chromatography-- After removal of arginine by dialysis, the refolded protein was loaded on an SP-Sepharose column equilibrated with 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. The bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (100 mM NaCl to 1.5 M NaCl). Fractions containing refolded PvRII were pooled, and PvRII was further purified by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).

They were sonicated for 45 s at room temperature and centrifuged for 10 min at 12000 g. The inclusion bodies pellet was then resuspended with the same volume ratio in 0.1 M Tris pH 8, 6 M guanidine-HCl (Gu-HCl), 5 mM DTT and rotated for 1-2 h on a rotary mixer. The extract was centrifuged at 12000 g for 10 min and the supernatant was put in a dialysis cassette of MWCO 3500 (Pierce) and submitted to the refolding protocol of Tsumoto et al. [K. Tsumoto, K.

Immunol. Methods 1998; 219:119-129.]. The concentration of Gu-HCl in the dialysis bath ( 1 l of 0.1 M Tris pH 8, for a 10 ml cassette) was decreased in the following steps: 6 M ? 3 M ? 2 M  ? 1 M ? 0.5 M ? 0 M. Step changes were applied overnight for 6 M , overday for 3 M, overnight for 2 M, and so on. Oxidized glutathione (250 µM) and reduced glutathione (500 µM) were added at the 1 M Gu-HCl step and readded with 0.4 M arginine at the 0.5 M Gu-HCl step. Precipitation occurred in the last step but was not due to PSC33. The refolded protein was then applied to a semipreparative (10 x 250 mm) C18 (10 µm 300 ?) reverse phase HPLC column (Vydac) operated at 3 ml/min and 40°C with a Waters 600 pump. Buffer A was 0.1% TFA in water, Buffer B was 100% CH3CN + 0.04% TFA.

Important to note is that SB12 which can be purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland) needs to be purified  by passing a solution of detergent in methanol/chloroform (1:1) over an Al2O3 column to remove all acidic impurities present in the commercial preparation. \nAfter incubation overnight at 4 C, the refolding buffer (con taining refolded protein) was neutralised with HCl to pH7.5 and 10 mM Tris was added to buffer the solution. This neutralization was performed to stabilize the refolded state of the protein (conformation of protein unstable in alkaline conditions). Subsequently, to remove ethanolamine the solution was washed in a concentrator with 10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5 % SB12, pH 7.5 (buffer A).\nTo remove unfolded protein and other contaminants, the in vitro folded Opa protein was purified by ion-exchange chromatography. An SP-Sepharose-HP column was equilibrated with buffer A, loaded with approximately 10 mg refolded protein and washed twice. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 1 M. Because the Opa proteins belong to the group of heat-modifiable proteins, refolding could easily be monitored by SDS-PAGE performed under semi-native and denaturing conditions at the same time this allowed us to check the purity of the protein.

The bacteria was put into buffer A and crashed by ultrasonic processor in an ice-water bath and then centrifuged at 18,000 rpm for 15 min. The isolated inclusion bodywas washed once for each of buffer B, buffer C and buffer D, respectively. After that, the clean inclusion body was dissolved in 7.0 mol L?1 GuHCl solution. After incubation at 4 ?C for 24 h with full agitation, the extract of the rhIFN-gamma was obtained by centrifuging at 20,000 rpm.\nThe unit of simultaneous renaturation and purification of proteins (USRPP) and chromatographic columns of HPHIC were initially equilibrated with solution A, at least for 15 min at each selected flow-rate before injecting a sample solution and then a linear gradient elution of 0?00% solution B at different times was performed at a selected flow rate and detected at 280 nm. The selection of flow rate depends on the size of column, or the USRPP and detected at 280 nm. The eluted fractions of the aim proteins were collected for the measurements of the recoveries of bioactivity and mass of the rhIFN-gamma.				12	2	2M urea + 50 mM PBS, pH7.0	1		Escherichia coli	DH5?	pBV 220	37	12h	0	no tag	0		1	95%	1458	106	271	2005-09-20	2007-10-08	insoluble	1	2218	1	1	n	n			unknown	n/a	NULL	1572

Purified, unfolded FepA was diluted to a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml with TE buffer and brought to room temperature. An equal volume of 10% Zwittergent-3,14 was added to the protein solution with stirring. A 10% stock solution of sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS) was added to a final concentration of 1%, and the mixture was stirred for 5 minutes. The detergent concentrations added correspond to 500 times the critical micelle concentration (cmc) for Zwittergent-3,14 and 17 times the cmc for SDS. The protein-detergent mixture was then applied to a Sephacryl S-300 26/60 gel filtration column (Pharmacia Amersham Biotech) equilibrated with 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 / 1 M NaCl / 0.05% Zwittergent-3,14 / 10 mM EDTA / 0.02% NaN3 (room temperature). The column was eluted at 1 ml/minute and 2 ml fractions were collected. Peak fractions were analysed for refolded protein by SDS-Page electrophoresis, as folded FepA (and other outer membrane proteins) has a faster electrophoretic mobility on polyacrylamide gels than unfolded FepA, and therefore can be distinguished from unfolded material by this technique. This occurs because the folded beta barrel is stable in SDS sample buffer and can only be completely unfolded by heating at 100ºC. Fractions containing primarily refolded protein were pooled.\n\nFolded FepA was separated from unfolded material by anion exchange chromatography (Mono-Q 10/10; Pharmacia) in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 / 1% octyl polyoxyethylene monoether (C8-POE; Bachem) / 1 mM EDTA, at 4ºC. FepA was eluted with a linear (0 – 500 mM) NaCl gradient at 1 ml/minute, and 1ml fractions were collected. Unfolded FepA eluted at 75 mM NaCl, whereas folded FepA eluted at 150 mM NaCl. Fractions containing folded FepA were pooled and concentrated to 1 mg/ml, then applied to a Sepharose S-300 26/60 column in the same buffer containing 200 mM NaCl and 0.02% NaN3 (also at 4ºC). Fractions containing pure, folded FepA were pooled. For crystallisation experiments, the detergent and buffer components were exchanged using a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B anion exchange column. Yields range from 5-10 mg purified, refolded FepA per litre of cell culture.	n/a		5-10 mg per lit	19	6	solubilization buffer plus NaCl	1	5 mg/ml	Escherichia coli	BL21	pET17b	37	15 hrs	n/a	no tag	0		1	High	1279	371	572	2006-03-10	2006-03-10	soluble	1	3062	2	2	n	n	600	0.6	Not stated	n/a	n/a	8m4n1

Dialysis was performed by first adjusting 6 M guanidine-denatured MKP3 to 0.25 mg/mL and then exchanging the sample into TBS (pH 7.6) containing 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, and 8 M urea. The gradual removal of urea was completed by a half-wise substitution of dialysis buffer every 4 h using fresh TBS containing 1 mM EDTA and 5 mM DTT at pH 7.6.	Due to the problems associated with the residual arginine and guanidine, refolding of MKP3 by dialysis was also tested as an alternative refolding method. MKP3 refolded by this method yielded a comparable specific activity at 11.6 microM NP product/min/mg in the presence of DMSO.\n\nWhile the dilution-based refolding method was a simpler, less time consuming technique for renaturation, the need to perform a final dialysis step to remove residual guanidine and arginine eliminated the benefits of the method. Therefore, stepwise dialysis of the 6 M guanidine-solubilized MKP3 into TBS was adopted for refolding subsequent samples of MKP3.		n/a	4	2	TBS	4	1 mg/mL	Escherichia coli	BL21(DE3)	pET-15b	37	1.5-2 hr	1 mM	no	600	0.5	59	n/a	1301	2	577	2007-05-05	2007-05-05	insoluble	1	2234	2	2	n	n	600	0.5	An MKP3-producing BL21(DE3)/MKP3 starter culture was established overnight in a 50 mL conical tube containing 12 mL LB broth and 50 microg/mL carbenicillin.

Transformed\ncolonies were inoculated into a 50-mL LB-ampicillin\n(50 mg/mL) flask and incubated for 5 h at 37 C, and then 20\nmL of the growing culture was removed and added into a fresh\n500-mL LB-Amp (50 mg/mL) medium. After induction with 1\nmM IPTG at an A600 of  0.6, cells were harvested after 3 h of\ninduction. Cell pellets were collected by centrifugation and\nstored at  80 C. Cells were lysed in 50 mL lysis buffer (10\nmM Tris-HCl [pH 7.2], 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 8 M urea)\nfor 30 min at 25 C. The lysate was then cleared by centrifugation\nat 12,000g for 20 min at 10 C. The cleared supernatant\nwas applied to a Q Sepharose column (2.5 7.5 cm) pre-equilibrated\nwith lysis buffer. The column was washed with 5  bed\nvolumes of Q wash buffer I (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.2], 1 mM\nDTT, 1 mM PMSF, 8 M urea, 85 mM NaCl), and 5  volumes\nof Q wash buffer II (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.2], 8 M urea, 150\nmM NaCl). The protein was eluted in 3 volumes of Q elution\nbuffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.2], 8 M urea, 200 mM NaCl).\nThe eluant from the Q Sepharose was then loaded directly onto\na hydroxyapatite column (1.5 12 cm). The column was preequilibrated\nwith Q elution buffer. After loading, the column\nwas washed with 2  volumes of HA wash buffer I (1 mM\npotassium phosphate [pH 6.8], 8 M urea, 1 M NaCl) and\nthen with 2  volumes of HA wash buffer II (25 mM potassium\nphosphate [pH 6.8], 8 M urea). The protein was eluted using a\nstepwise gradient of 75 mM and 125 mM potassium phosphate\n(pH 6.8) in 8 M urea and then with 2  volumes of 125 mM\npotassium phosphate (pH 6.8) in 8 M urea.

After incubation for 16 h at 4 deg. C, the solution was further diluted (20-fold) by addition of 0.7 M arginine (pH 9.4), 1 M NaCl, 0.5 mM oxidized glutathione, 1 mM reduced glutathione. Refolding of pro-BACE2 was completed after incubation for two to three days at 4 deg. C. To generate mature BACE2, we introduced an autoactivation step prior to purification, to avoid the aggregation of pro-BACE2. Autoactivation was achieved by adjusting the pH of the protein solution to 3.2 with citric acid (final concentration 5–10 mM) and hydrochloric acid. The precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation and the pH value of the clear supernatant adjusted to 6.8 by addition of Tris (final concentration 20 mM) and NaOH. Purification was started by adding ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 1.5 M to apply the refolded protein to a butyl Sepharose column. BACE2 was eluted in a single step with 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 6.8), containing 350 mM NaCl and subsequently concentrated for size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). To complete autoactivation, the pH of the protein solution was again adjusted to 3.2 and the precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation. The activated BACE2 was then purified by gel-filtration chromatography using a 26/60 Superdex 75 column equilibrated with 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 6.8), 350 mM NaCl.	A two-step procedure was developed to solubilize and refold the enzyme as described in Materials and Methods, which led to minimal precipitation of protein during the refolding procedure. However, analysis of the refolded material by size-exclusion chromatography revealed that most of the enzyme aggregated in the form of soluble, high molecular mass protein complexes. This protein form was not able to autoactivate, possibly due to the formation of wrong intra- and intermolecular disulfide bonds. To further optimize the refolding conditions, we have used high concentrations of salt (up to 2 M NaCl) and have performed the refolding at various pH values (7.0 - 9.5). Under these conditions, we have observed a significant portion of the refolded protein to be monomeric. Monomeric pro-BACE2 can be activated by shifting the pH to 3.4.		100 mg/l	12	2	50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0)	5	n/a	Escherichia coli	BL21(DE3)pLysS	pro-BACE2	37	n/a	0.5 mM	no	0	n/a	53	n/a	1520	2	584	2007-10-25	2007-10-26	insoluble	1	2463	1	2	n	n	n/a	n/a	E. coli cells BL21(DE3)pLysS harboring the respective pro-BACE2 expression plasmid were induced with 0.5 mM IPTG.

The solution was then rapidly diluted at least 20-fold to 20–100 ?g/mL total protein concentrations with various refolding buffers, gently agitated at 4 °C for at least 16 h, and assayed. The refolding buffers were constituted of 0.1 M NaH2PO4, 0.01 M Tris–HCl, 10 mM ?-ME, 0.5 mM PMSF, and different additives at pH 8, including dextran (3%, w/v), glycerol (10?50%, v/v), and PEG (MW = 3350; 10?30%, w/v or 8000; 10?20%, w/v). To investigate the pH effect on refolding, refolding buffers containing 50% glycerol at different pHs (6.5, 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0) were used. After the refolding, DCaseH was purified by native IMAC and subsequently dialyzed, following the procedures as previously described [11].\n\nTo refold IMAC-purified denatured DCaseH, denatured DCaseH eluted from Co-TANOL gels was first dialyzed with the denaturing buffer to remove imidazole. After the determination of the protein concentration, the solution was rapidly diluted by about 40-fold to 50 ?g/mL with the refolding buffers containing either 40 or 50% glycerol at pH 8, gently agitated at 4 °C for at least 24 h, and subjected to the enzymic assay and CD analysis.

E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying pDAH and pDAH2 were the strains used to produce intact WT DCase and fusion DCaseH enzymes, respectively. Both enzymes were expressed under the control of the bacteriophage T7 promoter. For routine production, a Luria-Bertani (LB) broth containing 30 g/mL kanamycin was inoculated by a single colony and incubated overnight at 37 C. The culture was then diluted 10-fold with the same medium and grown in a shaking flask. When the OD600nm value reached 0.4-0.5, isopropyl--D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 0.02 mM to induce the protein expression, and the incubation was continued for another 6 h at 37 C before cell harvesting. To investigate the optimal conditions for the enzyme production, cell pellets harvested from 10 mL cultures, which were cultivated with the variation of the IPTG concentration and the cultivation time and temperature after the induction, were suspended in 1 mL of phosphate buffer (PB; 50 mM Na2HPO4, 50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7) containing 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), disrupted by sonication, clarified by centrifugation, and assayed.

The clear supernatant was then mixed with Co-TANOL gels to purify native DCaseH, and the insoluble fraction was first washed twice with lysis buffer and subsequently either refolded as described below or purified with denaturing IMAC.

E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was transformed with the vector for over-expression. Cultures were grown at 37 °C and induced at an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.5–0.6 with 1 mM isopropyl ?--1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Cells were harvested three hours after induction by centrifugation at 4000g for 20 minutes at 4 °C, washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with Complete Block (Roche) protease inhibitors, pelleted again by centrifugation and stored frozen at ?20 °C.\n\nCell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold PBS supplemented with 6.5 M urea (PBS-U) and Complete Block protease inhibitors (Roche), placed in an ice-bath and sonicated for a total of one minute using a low-intensity probe (Misonix).

The cleared lysate was collected and passed through a 0.2 ?m filter and loaded onto a His Trap column (Amersham) equilibrated with PBS-U at 4 °C. The cleared lysate was circulated slowly through the column for 30 minutes. The column was washed with PBS-U containing 20 mM imidazole, and the sample was eluted with PBS-U containing 500 mM imidazole. The washing and elution buffers were supplemented with 500 mM NaCl, Complete Block (Roche) protease inhibitors and 50 mM glycine to scavenge cynate.

The suspension was then sonicated and centrifuged at 10 000×g for 10 min at 4°C. The insoluble fraction yielded inclusion bodies together with the insoluble cell fragments, and it was dissolved in solubilisation buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, containing 2 mM EDTA, 8 M urea and 50 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)). Refolding was initiated by slowly diluting the solubilised pellet to a final concentration of 20 ?g ml?1 into renaturation buffer and incubating for at least 24 h at room temperature. The renaturation buffer was composed of 20 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, containing 3 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 10 mM MgCl2.\n\nThe solution was concentrated by ultrafiltration on a PM 50 membrane with a stirred cell (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA, USA) to a final volume of 10 ml. The buffer was exchanged to 20 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, containing 2.5 M (NH4)2SO4, 1 mM EDTA and 10 mM MgCl2 prior to further chromatography on a DEAE-cellulose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with the same buffer, and the enzyme was eluted with the renaturation buffer. Fractions containing isocitrate dehydrogenase activity were pooled and, finally, dialysed against the same renaturation buffer for 24 h at 4°C to remove the (NH4)2SO4 remaining, and stored at this temperature.	n/a		n/a	1	2	unknown	4	20 ug/ml	Escherichia coli	BL21(DE3)	pET3a	37	3 h	0.4 mM	no tag	0	600	1	n/a	1527	996	587	2007-11-07	2007-11-12	insoluble	1	1703	2	2	n	n	0.5	600	2.3. Expression of H. volcanii isocitrate dehydrogenase in E. coli\n\nPCR techniques were used to amplify a gene fragment corresponding to the structural gene of H. volcanii ICDH with 1260 bp, including the digestion sequences of NdeI and BamHI to facilitate the subcloning of the H. volcanii ICDH gene for expression. Template DNA for PCR was the clone from the ? EMBL3 library. The PCR product was subcloned into plasmid pCR?.1. After transforming E. coli Novablue cells (Novagen) with this construct, plasmid DNA was ligated into expression vector pET-3a (Novagen). The resulting clones were propagated in E. coli Novablue cells prior to transforming E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Novagen), which was used as the expression host. Cultures were grown to an OD600nm at 37°C of 0.5?.0 in Luria–Bertani (LB) medium containing 50 ?g ml?1 ampicillin. Induction of expression was achieved by the addition of isopropyl ?--thiogalactoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.4 mM, and the cultures were shaken at 37°C for 3 h before harvesting cells by centrifugation.	n/a	n/a	8v5d7

To investigate the effect of sample application on the aggregate formation between the injector and column inlet, stream before column inlet was directly connected to the detector to monitor the aggregates. That is, the SEC column was temporarily removed and the detector was set at 450 nm for aggregates measurement.

Then, the bacteria cell lysate was prepared by sonication at 4°C. The supernatant was removed by centrifugation at 12,000×g for 15 min, and the pellet (inclusion bodies) was used for purification. The inclusion bodies were dissolved in 8 M urea (containing 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), pH 8.0), and centrifuged at 12,000×g for 15 min to collect the supernatant for 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) electrophoresis. The protein refolding was processed by dialysis against the buffer systems (50 mM Tris–HCl buffer, 3 mM glutathione reduced, 1 mM glutathione oxidized, pH 8.0), containing 6, 4, 2, 1, and 0.5 M urea, respectively, to decrease, gradually, the concentration of urea in the protein solution to 0.5 M, then kept it overnight at 4°C, and finally, the residual urea was eliminated by dialysis against the same buffer but containing no urea.	n/a		n/a	1	2	50 mM Tris-HCl	29	n/a	Escherichia coli	BL21(DE3)	pET32a(+)	37	3 h	1 mM	no	0	600	9	n/a	1588	1037	605	2007-12-04	2007-12-04	insoluble	1	1283	1	2	n	n	0.5	600	Construction of the vector pET32a(+)-TDEF1\nTo obtain clones merely with the mature peptide coding region of TDEF1, a primer, called MP1 with BamHI site (5&#8242;-CGA GGA&#8201; TCC AGA ACA TGT CAG-3&#8242;), was designed based on the mature peptide coding sequence of the target clone obtained above. PCR reaction (with MP1 and SP2 as primers) were as follows: 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 45 s, 72°C for 30 s, and finally, 72°C for a 10-min extension. The amplified product was cloned into pMD18-T and sequenced. The recombinant vector pMD18-T-TDEF1 was digested with BamHI and HindIII, and the resulting fragment of TDEF1 was cloned into the BamHI and HindIII sites of the expression vector pET32a(+), which was designated pET32a(+)-TDEF1. It was introduced into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. The empty vector was also introduced into BL21 (DE3) as a control.\n\nFusion protein production in E. coli\nE. coli BL21 (DE3) cells containing a plasmid of interest were grown at 37°C for 14 h in 5 ml LB medium containing appropriate antibiotics (50 &#956;g/ml of ampicillin).

Cells were lysed by two to three passages through a French pressure cell, 16,000 psi. Inclusion bodies containing SDF-1&#945; were isolated through centrifugation at 15,000g and the supernatant was discarded. The insoluble inclusion body pellet was solubilized using buffer AD (50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, and 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride) and batch loaded onto 5 mL disposable columns containing 2 mL of Ni sepharose™ 6 fast flow resin (Amersham/GE Healthcare). After a 30 min incubation the column was washed 4× with 10 mL of buffer AD and eluted with buffer BD (50 mM sodium acetate pH 4.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, and 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride). The eluted SDF-1&#945; was dialyzed twice against 4 L of 0.3% (v/v) acetic acid. 2-mercaptoethanol was added to the dialyzed SDF-1&#945; to a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v). NaH2PO4 and NaCl to a final concentration of 50 mM were also added and the pH was raised to 6.5–6.75 with NaOH. Tobacco etch virus protease (TEV) was then added to this solution to remove the hexahistadine tag (1:1000 w/w). The disulfide bonds in SDF-1&#945; were formed through diluting protease digestion solution from 30–40 to 150 mL with 20 mM Tris pH 8.0 to raise the pH followed by dialysis against 4 L of the same buffer. Dialysis-based SDF1-&#945; oxidation fails if the hexahistadine tag is not removed before oxidation. After disulfide bond formation the SDF-1&#945; was concentrated to 30 mL using ultrafiltration and acidified with HCl (pH < 3.0). SDF-1&#945; was then purified to greater than 98% homogeneity using reverse phase (RP) HPLC in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) with a 30 min CH3CN gradient from 21 to 42%. Purified SDF-1&#945; was lyophilyzed and then dissolved in 80% aqueous TFA with 100-fold molar excess of CNBr overnight. Removal of the residual N-terminal Gly-Met dipeptide (which remained after digestion with TEV protease) was verified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Cleaved SDF-1&#945; was lyophilyzed and repurified by RP HPLC.

Lysozyme at 50 mg/mL was denatured and reduced in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH8.5) containing 8 M urea, 30 mM DTT, and 1 mM EDTA. The mixture was incubated at 37 C for 3 h under N2. After the mixture reached room temperature, DTT was removed by a HiTrap desalting column (5 mL, Amersham Biosciences). Prior to separation, the column was\nequilibrated with 25 mL of 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) containing 8 M urea and 1 mM EDTA, which was also used as the elution solution for separation. The flow rate was about 1.0 mL/min. The complete reduction of disulfide bonds and removal of DTT were confirmed by thiol titration according to Ellmans method. The lysozyme concentrations were determined by UV\nabsorbance at 280 nm using extinction coefficients of 2.63 and 2.37 cm·mg/mL for native and denatured forms, respectively.20 All UV absorbance measurements were performed with a Shimadzu UV-3101PC spectrophotometer.\n\nAdsorption of Denatured Lysozyme (D-Lys) on Mesoporous Materials. With stirring, mesoporous materials (2 mg/mL) were dispersed in D-Lys solutions of various initial concentrations in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) containing 6 M urea and 1 mM EDTA. The amount adsorbed was calculated by subtracting the UV absorbance at 280 nm of the supernatant after centrifugation from that of D-Lys before adsorption.\n\nElution of Entrapped Protein. D-Lys (0.6 mg/mL) was loaded in 10 mg of mesoporous materials by stirringfor 2 h. The protein-entrapped solids were recovered by centrifugation. Elution tests were performed by adding 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer solution (pH 8.5) containing 2 M urea, 1 mM EDTA, and PEG (MW 2000) at\nvarious concentrations to the recovered solids with stirring at room temperature. The volume of elution buffer added was determined by the adsorption capacity, giving a mixture of 1 mg of D-Lys per mL of solution. For example, 1.6 mL of elution solution was added to protein-containing E-PMO-A (164 mg of protein per g). At different time intervals, eluted proteins in solution were removed after centrifugation, and the same amounts of fresh buffer solutions were added again.\n\nProtein Refolding. By the batch dilution method, refolding was initiated by a rapid 30-fold dilution of concentrated protein solution into refolding buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 M urea, 1.5 mM GSH, 0.3 mM GSSG, pH 8.5) at room temperature. Identical aliquots of the refolding sample were withdrawn and immediately assayed for enzymatic activity. In the case of PMO-assisted refolding, D-Lys (0.6 mg/mL) was\nfirst loaded into E-PMO-A (20 mg), as described above. After adsorption for 2 h, protein-containing E-PMO-A (164 mg/g) was recovered by centrifugation. The refolding buffer (3.2 mL of 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) containing 2 M urea, 1 mM EDTA, 1.5 mM GSH, 0.3 mM GSSG, and PEG at various concentrations (from 10 to 75 mg/mL) was then added. After the solution was stirred\nfor 20 h, the supernatant was recovered by centrifugation. The concentrations of recovered protein were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay method. Native lysozyme was used as a protein standard.\n\nProtein Activity Assay. The lysozyme activity was assayed at room temperature by monitoring the decrease in UV absorbance at 450 nm of a Micrococcus lysodeikticus cell suspension (0.20 mg/mL in 67 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.2). Renatured lysozyme solutions were first diluted with 100 mM Tris-HCl\nbuffer (pH 8.5) to the desired concentrations. A diluted protein sample (100 L) was then mixed with 3.0 mL of the cell suspension. A linear decrease in absorbance was observed, and the slope from 10 to 60 s was used to calculate the refolding yield by comparing to a native lysozyme solution of identical protein concentration. The activity of native lysozyme of\nequal concentration was 100%.

The cell pellet was washed twice with 50 mL of buffer containing detergent (25 mM potassium phosphate, 0.25% deoxycholate, pH 7.5) followed by two 50 mL washes in the same buffer without detergent. Refolding and oxidation of the two disulfides were achieved by solubilizing the pellet in a minimal amount of 6 M guanidinium chloride and diluting it 100-fold into a redox buffer containing 100 mM Tris, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.2 mM oxidized glutathione, 1 mM reduced glutathione, pH 8.0. After overnight stirring at 4 C, the solution was adjusted to pH 7.0, centrifuged, filtered, and loaded onto a 30 mL Sepharose SP fast flow column. The column was washed with 2-3 bed volumes of 10 mM potassium phosphate, 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.0, and the protein was eluted with a salt gradient of 0.25-0.65 M in the same buffer. Final purification was achieved by reversed-phase HPLC on a Vydac C4 semi-prep column with a gradient of 26.0:73.9:0.1 to 38:61.9:0.1 acetonitrile/H2O/trifluoroacetic acid, followed by lyophilization.

Cell paste from a 1–2-liter culture was resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidizole, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM phenylmethylsufonyl fluoride) and lysed by two passes through a French pressure cell. Inclusion bodies were isolated by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C, resuspended in 10 ml of solubilization buffer (6 M guanidinium chloride, 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidizole, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol), disaggregated by passage through a 16-gauge needle, and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 10 min. This protein solution was incubated with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) in batch mode for 30 min at room temperature, packed into a 5-ml disposable column, and washed with 3 x 10-ml portions of solubilization buffer. Bound Ltn was eluted with 3 x 10-ml portions of elution buffer (6 M guanidinium chloride, 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidizole, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol). Eluted fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 3 x 4 liters of 0.3% (v/v) acetic acid to remove denaturant. Separation of the affinity tag was performed by adjusting the buffer conditions to 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, addition of a catalytic amount of tobacco etch virus protease (1,000:1), and incubation for 3 h at 22 °C. Formation of the single hLtn disulfide was accomplished by dropwise addition of the cleavage reaction into 150 ml of oxidation buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl), followed by dialysis of the oxidation reaction against 4 liters of oxidation buffer. Oxidized hLtn was concentrated to 20 ml by ultrafiltration in an Amicon stirred-cell using a 3-kDa molecular mass cutoff membrane. Fully refolded hLtn was separated from reduced or aggregated species by reversed-phased high performance liquid chromatography. Purity and identity of all hLtn variants were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry.	n/a		n/a	1	3	50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidizole, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM phenylmethylsufonyl fluoride	3	n/a	Escherichia coli	SG13009[pRPEP4]	pQE308HT-hLtn	37	3.5 h	1 mM	yes	0		2	n/a	1617	1037	612	2007-12-10	2007-12-10	insoluble	1	824	1	2	n	n	0.7-1.0	600	The hLtn expression plasmid, pQE308HT-hLtn, was transformed into E. coli strain SG13009[pRPEP4] (Qiagen).

After cloning into TA cloning vector pCRII (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) and complete sequence analysis, the amplified 0.4-kb PCR product was subcloned into the unique NdeI and SacI sites of an E. coli overexpression vector, pET-28b (Novagen, Madison, Wis.). Positive clones were identified by using PCR according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The correct in-frame fusion of the construct was verified by DNA sequencing of positive transformants before it was transformed into an E. coli BL21 (DE3) expression host. TI expression was induced by adding isopropyl-&#946;-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 1 mM as previously described (5).

The inclusion bodies (frozen pellets) were thawed and suspended in 30 ml of a washing buffer (100 mM Tris–Cl, 5 mM EDTA, 4% Triton X-100, 2 M urea, pH 8.0) and washed 4–5 times with the same buffer until a clear supernatant was obtained. Then the inclusion bodies were washed with wash buffer lacking urea and Triton X-100 to remove the denaturant and detergent. The pI of the protein was calculated from amino acid sequence data as 5.2 (Expasy ProtParam tool). The washed inclusion bodies were dissolved in 20 ml of buffer A (10 mM Tris–Cl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 9.5) containing 8 M urea, stirred continuously to solubilize the protein and incubated at 4 °C for 12 h to ensure complete denaturation. The suspension was centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble particles to get a clear solution. A Q-Sepharose (Pharmacia) anion exchanger column (1.5 × 10 cm.) was equilibrated with 5 bed volumes of buffer A containing 8 M urea. The protein solubilized in urea was loaded onto the equilibrated column with flow rate 25 ml/hour. The column was washed with one bed volume of buffer A containing 8 M urea. After binding the protein the column was treated with a gradient of urea (8 to 0 M) in two bed volumes of buffer A to gradually remove the denaturant. The column was washed with two bed volumes of buffer A to ensure the complete removal of urea. The bound protein was eluted by multi-step elution, each step of one bed volume, with buffer containing 100 mM, 200 mM and then 300 mM NaCl. Flow rate was 25 ml/h. In such purification procedure the last step was size exclusion chromatography. Thus, we could get pure protein in its native state (i.e. in the absence of any denaturant), as established later by recording a 2D [15N-1H] HSQC. Concentration of the protein was estimated using an extinction coefficient value (at 280 nm) of 5960 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1, which was determined from its amino acid sequence using Expasy ProtParam tool (www.expasy.org).	n/a		n/a	2	2	100 mM Tris–Cl, 5 mM EDTA, 4% Triton X-100, 2 M urea, pH 8.0	1	n/a	Escherichia coli	BL21(DE3)	pET21a	37	4 h	1 mM	no tag	0		1	n/a	1784	1037	1024	2008-02-14	2008-02-14	insoluble	1	596	1	2	n	n	0.6	600	Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells containing pET21a-Hahellin recombinant plasmid were inoculated from a single colony and grown overnight in Luria–Bertani (LB)1 media containing 100 &#956;g/ml ampicillin at 37 °C by shaking at 225 rpm. After 12 h, 2.5 ml of culture was transferred into 250 ml of LB media with 100 &#956;g/ml ampicillin. After growing the culture until A600 reached 0.6 in LB medium, the heterologous protein synthesis was induced by the addition of IPTG (isopropyl-&#946;-d-thiogalactopyranoside) to a final concentration of 1 mM. After further incubation for 4 h at 37 °C, cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet (1.2 g) was suspended in 5 ml of a lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–Cl, 2 mM EDTA, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2 containing 0.5 mM PMSF, pH 8.0). The cell suspension was extensively sonicated (20 × 1 min, Branson sonifier 450) on ice. The resulting cell lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant and the pellet were checked for the presence of the protein. The protein predominantly overexpressed in the form of inclusion bodies. Therefore, inclusion bodies were used for protein purification.	n/a	n/a	9g3n6

The refolding reaction was initiated at 25 °C by ten-fold dilution of the urea-treated protein with TNE buffer. The final protein concentrations were 0.3–3 &#956;M. The time-dependent fluorescence of tryptophan changes were monitored at excitation and emission wavelengths of 295 nm and 350 nm, respectively.

In a first attempt, we tried to produce these two sub-domains including the irrespective hinges at the N- and C-terminal ends but the proteins precipitated. Finally, we decided to produce the proteins without any extension from the hinges. The construct corresponding to the single repeat R2 was from the group of W. Gratzer [8] and now known to have extensions of 8 residues at the N-terminal end and of 6 residues at the C-terminal end. By contrast, to improve its solubility, R23 was extended with 6 additional residues at the N-terminal end including the N-terminal glycine–serine dipeptide and 7 additional residues at the C-terminal end according to Kahana et al. [19] and [20] which recommended to extend the constructs by 6 to 8 residues. The Glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene fusion system was used to produce recombinant dystrophin rod domain R23 single repeat and R1–3 and R20–24 sub-domains, whose boundaries are indicated in Table 1. The pGEX-4T1 vectors with cDNAs encoding R23, R1–3 and R20–24 were transformed into the protease-deficient Escherichia coli ER2566 strain, and cultures were then grown to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.5–0.8 at 37 °C in LB broth supplemented with 50 &#956;g/mL ampicillin. Expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mM isopropyl-&#946;-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 4 h, bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 g for 15 min at 4 °C.

After renaturation, ONC was purified on a SOURCE S column (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden; 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, with a linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl). Cyclization of the N-terminal glutamine residue was achieved by dialysis of the purified protein against 200 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) for 3 days at room temperature. The protein concentration was determined using an absorption coefficient of &#949; = 0.87 mL·mg&#8722;1·cm&#8722;1 at 280 nm [12]. Determination of the molecular mass to verify cyclization of the N-terminal pyroglutamate was performed by ESI (Esquire) or MALDI MS (Reflex; both from Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) after desalting of the protein samples using ZipTip pipette tips (Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany).Refolding experiments followed by stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopyRefolding was followed by stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy using an SX20 stopped-flow spectrometer (Applied Photophysics Ltd, Leatherhead, UK). Emission was recorded as integral fluorescence using a 320 nm cut-off filter with excitation at 280 nm at 20 °C. Refolding was initiated by 11-fold dilution of denatured protein samples (in 6.0 m guanidine hydrochloride) into lower concentrations of denaturant. The final protein concentration was typically 5 µm, and final buffer conditions were 100 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5), containing concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride as indicated. Kinetic traces were fitted to either single, double or triple exponential equations. Amplitudes and rate constants were usually the average from three to five measurements.\nTo assess artefacts due to the rapid mixing, control reactions were carried out using a solution of N-acetyl-l-tryptophanamide in the same molar concentration as the Tryp residues in the protein solution (5–10 µm) under the same experimental conditions as described above for the folding experiments.	n/a		n/a	2	5	n/a	1	n/a	Escherichia coli	BL21(DE3)	pET26b	37	4 h	1 mM	no tag	0	n/a	1	n/a	1819	1037	1039	2008-02-25	2008-02-27	insoluble	1	532	2	2	n	n	n/a	n/a	The experimental procedures were performed as described previously [10].

Dissolved IB protein solutions were then diluted to the indicated detergent or urea (&#8804;1.5 M) concentrations to control final refold protein concentrations between 0.2 and 2 mg/ml depending on the experiment.\nFor the initial detergent-comparison studies, two concentrations were evaluated: 0.2 and 0.5%. After solubilization, refolds were initiated by dilution or by the addition of 1 mM cysteine after 1 h or in combination as described above. Untreated samples served as the control. Each detergent was dissolved in 100 mM Tris/HCl, pH 9.7, with a protein concentration of 0.2 mg of PMP-1a/ml determined by quantitative RP-HPLC. Samples were taken at dissolution (t=0), 1 h after cysteine addition and for timed points after that up to 72 h, held at 2–8 °C in sample trays and typically assayed immediately by RP-HPLC and both SDS and non-SDS SEC–HPLC analyses. Although the effect of freeze–thaw on protein oxidation or aggregation was not studied explicitly, samples were occasionally frozen before analysis without unusual results or structural artefacts being observed.\nAt 1–24 h following IB dissolution, catalytic amounts (0.7–5 mM) of the thiol-group-containing reagents cysteine, DTT and/or cystine were added as indicated and refolding was allowed to proceed for 15 h.	n/a		n/a	21	8	chilled,purified watter	11	n/a	Escherichia coli	DH5a	n/a	37	4 h	n/a	no tag	0		1	n/a	1810	1037	1040	2008-02-25	2008-02-25	insoluble	1	219	1	4	n	n	13.5	550	The construction of the plasmid expression vector for PMP-1a and transformation into E. coli have been described elsewhere [19].

Approx. 500 ml of the primary seed inoculum was transferred to a 10-litre fermenter containing M9 medium [19a]+2% casamino acids with glucose concentrations maintained between 2 and 6 g/l. The culture was continued at 37 °C with aeration and agitation. The pH of the culture was maintained at 7.0 by the addition of ammonium hydroxide, which also served as a nitrogen source. The fermentation was grown for an additional 4 h following induction with nalidixic acid at a D550 value of 13.5. The fermentation broth was cooled to 15 °C and transferred to a harvest tank. The broth was centrifuged to collect the cells, and the resulting cells were washed once by resuspension and centrifugation at 10 °C in 10 mM Tris/EDTA (pH 8.0) followed by homogenization using a microfluidizer (3000 lbf/in2; 1 lbf/in2=6.9 kPa; Microfluidics).

There is no intron in this gene [9]. The PCR product was cloned into pMD-T vector for DNA sequencing. Bbchit1 gene excised from pMD-T vector by NcoI and EcoRI was inserted into the corresponding sites of pET28a. BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with the recombinant plasmid and pET28a plasmid, respectively. The latter was used as a negative control.\nThe expression of Bbchit1 was followed the guidelines of Novagen. A 50 &#956;l overnight culture of BL21 carrying the recombinant plasmid was inoculated into 15 ml LB medium supplemented with 50 &#956;g/ml kanamycine.

This process was repeated three times to minimize the amount of unaggregated IL-1ra remaining in the precipitate. The aggregates were resuspended in 600 mL of reducing buffer at an IL-1ra concentration of approximately 5.5 mg/mL and placed in heat-sealed 1 mL polypropylene syringes. Samples were pressurized slowly over 10 min to minimize system heating and then incubated at 318C for 14 h (overnight) at pressures of 1,500 or 1 bar (atmospheric control). Previous studies have demonstrated that 14 h incubation times are adequate refolding times for many proteins (Kim et al., 2006). The samples were slowly depressurized over 10 min. After depressurization, the samples were centrifuged and concentration of soluble protein was measured by absorbance.\nAggregate concentration was measured by dissolving the precipitate in 750 mL of 8 M guanidine HCl prior to extinction coef&#64257;cient analysis. Solubilization yields were determined by dividing the monomer mass fraction by the total protein concentration (monomer and aggregate) and then converting the result to a percentage.

Samples were slowly pressurized (over 10 min) to minimize system heating and were then held at the desired temperature and pressure. Two different depressurization protocols were used. For slow depressurization, pressures were reduced by 5% of the initial pressure every 30 min until a pressure 20% of the initial pressure was reached. From this point, pressure was reduced by 10% (of the initial pressure) every 30 min until atmospheric pressure was obtained (about 8 h). Rapid depressurization occurred over a few seconds, when the pressurized system was opened to atmosphere. After depressurization, SEC-HPLC or RP-HPLC was conducted while the remaining samples were stored frozen at –20°C until further testing with SEC-HPLC, RP-HPLC, GEMMA, and activity assays. Freeze–thaw studies conducted at Bayer verified that monomer structure was unaffected by multiple freeze–thaw cycles (data not shown).\nIn addition, no significant changes in refolding yields and chromatograms were seen before and after freezer storage through SEC-HPLC and RP-HPLC.

Aggregation buffer consisted of 10 mM sodium citrate, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% sodium azide, pH 6.0, at 24 °C (\\"buffer\\"). A second set of rhGH aggregates was prepared identically, with the addition of 0.75 M GdnHCl in the aggregation buffer. Prior to pressurization, aggregates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was removed. The desired refolding buffer was then added, and the aggregates (0.87 mg/ml unless otherwise noted) were resuspended using a sonicating cell disrupter (Ultrasonics, 50% duty, 1-s cycles for 10 s).\nSample Pressurization-- Pressure was generated using high pressure nitrogen (400 bar) connected to equipment from High Pressure Equipment Co. (Erie, PA) as previously described (26) or with high pressure crank generators from High Pressure Equipment Co. Samples were prepared either in heat-sealed bulbs of SAMCO transfer pipettes or in sterile, disposable syringes (one end heat-sealed and the other sealed with the rubber plunger). Sealed samples were placed into a 2-liter pressure vessel equipped with a heating jacket, rated to 2000 bar. Samples were slowly pressurized (15 min) to final desired pressure to minimize pressurization-induced heating (less than 2 °C as measured by a thermocouple mounted in the interior of the vessel lid). The depressurization rate was ~100 bar/min.	n/a		n/a	1	1	n/a	1	n/a	None	None		0	0	0	no tag	0		1	n/a	1857	1037	1056	2008-03-06	2008-03-06		1	804	1	1	y	n					n/a	9n7b0

The molar ratio of oxidized to reduced glutathione (GSSG:GSG) was 1:1 because the mixture of 2 mM DTT and 6 mM GSSG rapidly converts to 4 mM GSH and 4 mM GSSG, with a byproduct of 2 mM oxidized DTT (St. John et al. 2002). For testing the effects of additives, urea (1 and 2 M), L-arginine (0.5 M), glycerol (2.5 M), Tween 20 (0.1 mM), or Triton X-100 (0.5 mM) were added to the refolding buffer. The critical micelle concentrations (CMCs) of Tween 20 (Sigma T8787) and Triton X-100 (Sigma P5927) provided by the supplier (Sigma) were 0.06 and 0.32 mM in water, respectively.\nSamples (~300 µL) were placed in sterile, disposable 1-mL syringes (one end heat sealed and the other sealed with the rubber plunger) and placed in a custom-made high-pressure vessel (St. John et al. 2001; Kim et al. 2005). The vessel was sealed and pressurized with a high-pressure crank generator (rated up to 700 MPa) from High Pressure Equipment Co., using water as a pressure transmitting fluid (St. John et al. 2001; Kim et al. 2005). Samples were slowly pressurized (~10 min) to the desired pressure and held there for 24 h. Unless otherwise specified, samples were depressurized at ~10 MPa per 10 min.

Cells were grown at 37°C to an OD600 of ~0.8 in 100 mL of Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 µg/mL amplicillin, and protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl--D-1-thiogalactoside. After a 6-h induction at 37°C, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 12,000g for 10 min at 4°C and resuspended in a 10-mL lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl at pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF). IBs were purified by following the procedure described previously (Bowden et al. 1991; De Bernardez Clark et al. 1999). The purified IBs were washed three times with double distilled water, and stored at –80°C until used. The contents of the expressed protein in purified IBs were more than 70% based on SDS-PAGE analyses (Fig. 1).

Briefly, residues 24–492 of GNBP1-ECD and residues 25–461 of GNBP2-ECD were cloned on pProEx-HTb (Invitrogen) using BamHI/XhoI sites, and residues 31–483 of GNBP3-ECD was subcloned into pProExHTc (Invitrogen) using EcoRI/XhoI sites. For the bacterial expression of the intracellular phosphatase domain of PTPRS and DUSP7, residues 1386–1948 of PTPRS and residues 1–130 of DUSP7 were subcloned onto pET28a (Novagen) using NdeI/BamHI sites, which were provided by Dr. J.S. Kim (Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology). E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) was used as an expression host. Cells were grown at 37°C to an OD600 of ~0.8 in 100 mL of Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 µg/mL amplicillin, and protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl--D-1-thiogalactoside. After a 6-h induction at 37°C, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 12,000g for 10 min at 4°C and resuspended in a 10-mL lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl at pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF). IBs were purified by following the procedure described previously (Bowden et al. 1991; De Bernardez Clark et al. 1999). The purified IBs were washed three times with double distilled water, and stored at –80°C until used. The contents of the expressed protein in purified IBs were more than 70% based on SDS-PAGE analyses (Fig. 1). After gel staining with Coomassie blue, the intensity of bands corresponding to monomeric proteins in the reducing and nonreducing SDS-PAGE was compared with estimate fractions of monomeric species in the nonreducing condition using an image analysis system (Model GS-700, Bio-Rad).	n/a	2.5/0.5/0.5/0.1 M	9z7b5

The washed inclusion body pellet was extracted with 20 ml, 50 mM Tris, 6 M GdmCl, 10 mM TCEP, pH 8 by disrupting the pellet manually and incubating it for 1 h at 4 °C. After extraction the mixture was centrifuged for 30 min at 32,000 rpm and 4 °C using an ultracentrifuge. Protein samples containing 6 M GdmCl were precipitated in the following way to check them by SDS–PAGE: Mix 30 &#956;l protein solution with 30 &#956;l H2O and 60 &#956;l 10% TCA and leave on ice for 20 min, centrifuge for 15 min in a microfuge (13,000 rpm), discard the supernatant and wash the pellet with 60 &#956;l ice cold ethanol, dry the pellet from ethanol and resuspend it in 60 &#956;l 2× sample buffer.\n\nTo further purify hFRB, the inclusion body extract was first diluted 1:3 with inclusion body extraction buffer and then 2:1 with 30% HPLC buffer B (90% acetonitrile/0.1%TFA) and applied to a preparative C4 HPLC column that had been equilibrated with 30% HPLC buffer B. HPLC buffer A was 0.1% TFA in water. To elute the protein a gradient was started that increased the concentration of buffer B by 1.4%/min; hFRB eluted around 52–60% B. Two hundred microliters of each fraction were dried in a SpeedVac and dissolved in 20 &#956;l 2× sample buffer to analyze them by SDS–PAGE. Those containing nearly pure hFRB were frozen in liquid nitrogen, lyophilized and stored at &#8722;20 °C. The protein concentration in each fraction was determined based on the absorption at 280 nm. Note that if the concentration of the loaded protein solution is rather high, the band corresponding to a hFRB dimer (Fig. 1, lanes 8–9) becomes accordingly stronger.\nRefolding of hFRB\nRefolding of hFRB was achieved by drop-wise dilution (1:200) of a stock solution of denatured protein into a native buffer [22]. The denatured protein stock solution was prepared by dissolving the lyophilized protein into 20 mM Tris, 6 M GdmCl, 10 mM TCEP, pH 8 to a final concentration of 0.1–0.9 mM. The dissolved protein was centrifuged 10 min at 13,000 rpm before use. The refolding buffer was always 20 mM Tris, 1 mM TCEP, pH 8 with different supplements (150 or 300 mM NaCl or 50 mM l-Glu/50 mM l-Arg or 20 mM l-Leu or 30% propanol-2). The buffer containing additionally 300 mM NaCl was the final refolding buffer. Refolding on a small scale (0.5 ml denatured protein solution, 100 ml refolding buffer) was done by injecting the denatured protein solution in small steps (7–10 within about 5–8 h, each 0.05–0.07 ml) from a 1 ml syringe with needle into a screw cap bottle on a magnetic stirrer that was kept at 4 °C. After all the denatured protein had been injected into the refolding buffer, the solution kept stirring overnight at 4 °C. The diluted protein solution was concentrated using an ultrafiltration spin column (Vivaspin20 from Vivascience) with an MWCO of 5000 according to the manufacturer’s manual. Refolding on a large scale was done by gravity flow from a syringe with a fine needle (BD Microlance™ 3, 25 G × 5/8&#8242;&#8242;, 0.5 mm × 16 mm). Refolding on an even larger scale (>20 ml) may be done using an electronic infusion injector or a peristaltic pump.	n/a		n/a	21	2	20 mM Tris, 1 M urea, 10 mM TCEP, pH 8	1	n/a	Escherichia coli	Rosetta (DE3)	pET-11a	37	overnight	1 mM	no	0		1	n/a	1875	1037	1058	2008-03-07	2008-03-07	insoluble	1	750	2	2	n	n	0.8	600	Expression of hFRB\nhFRB was expressed from Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) cells (Novagen). One hundred milliliters of LB medium supplemented with 100 &#956;g/ml ampicillin and 40 &#956;g/ml chloramphenicol were inoculated with a single colony of transformed cells and grown overnight at 30 °C. The starter culture was diluted 1:40 in 2 L LB medium or 1:20 in 2 L M9 minimal medium, both supplemented with 100 &#956;g/ml ampicillin and 40 &#956;g/ml chloramphenicol. For growth in minimal medium the cells were centrifuged gently for 5 min at 2000 rpm. The supernatant was discarded and the cells were resuspended in minimal medium. The prepared culture was grown at 37 °C to an OD600 of &#8776;0.8 and induced with 1 mM IPTG. The cells continued growing overnight at 37 °C. Uniformly 15N-labeled hFRB was prepared in minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source. The used M9 minimal medium contained M9 salts w/o NH4Cl, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 1× BME vitamin solution (Sigma), 4 g/L glucose, and 1 g/L 15NH4Cl.Cells expressing hFRB were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C (20 min, 5000 rpm, Sorvall SLA-3000 rotor). The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 ml lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM benzamidine, 2 mM DTT, pH 8). The cell suspension was supplemented with 1 ml of lysozyme stock solution (10 mg/ml) and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were disrupted by sonication on ice using a Branson Digital Sonifier and a power level of 40%. During sonication for 6 min, intervals of 3 s pulsing alternated with 7 s breaks. To verify that hFRB is in the inclusion body fraction 100 &#956;l of the sonicated cell suspension were centrifuged and the supernatant and the pellet checked by SDS–PAGE. After that the whole sonicated cell suspension was centrifuged for 30 min at 12,000 rpm (Sorvall SS34 rotor). 	n/a	n/a	9h7e7

The supernatant was loaded on a glutathione sepharose™ 4B column according to the manufacture’s manual (Amersham Biosciences). The GST-fusion protein was extracted with 50 mM Tris, 10 mM reduced glutathione, pH 8. The fractions containing GST-FPR1 were dialyzed to 1× PBS and digested with thrombin for 5 days at room temperature (20 U per 1 ml with 0.1 mM fusion protein). The cleaved GST was removed by RP HPLC, which was performed as described for hFRB but using a preparative C8 column. FPR1 eluted around 48–51%. Fractions were analyzed by SDS–PAGE and those containing nearly pure FPR1 were frozen in liquid nitrogen, lyophilized and stored at &#8722;20 °C. The lyophilized protein was refolded by dissolving it in 10 ml of 20 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, pH 8 to obtain about 20 &#956;M solution and concentrated using an ultrafiltration spin column (Vivaspin 20, Vivascience, MWCO 5000). That the protein adapted its native structure after refolding was confirmed from a comparison of its 1D 1H NMR spectrum with the one of the protein purified under native conditions using a 2nd glutathione sepharose™ 4B column after cleavage with thrombin. To have the protein purified in both ways in the same buffer, the one collected in the flow-through of the glutathione sepharose™ 4B column after thrombin cleavage was concentrated to about 0.5 ml using an ultrafiltration spin column (Vivaspin 20, Vivascience, MWCO 5000) and washed 2× with 17 ml of 20 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, pH 8.	n/a		n/a	21	2	n/a	1	n/a	Escherichia coli	Rosetta (DE3)	pGEX-4T	37	3 h	0.5 mM	yes	0		11	n/a	1876	1037	1058	2008-03-07	2008-03-07	soluble	1	809	2	2	n	n	1.0	600	The yeast FKBP-homolog FPR1 was expressed as N-terminal fusion to GST from E. coli Rosetta (DE3) cells (Novagen).

Inclusion bodies were thus solubilized by 1 min sonication in 5 M guanidium hydrochloride (GuHCl) and 20 mM imidazole–HCl pH 8.0. Remaining particles were removed by ultracentrifugation (15,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti 45 rotor, for 30 min at 4 °C) and the soluble fraction was purified by Ni-IMAC at 4 °C. A 10 ml Chelating Sepharose Fast-Flow column, preactivated with NiCl2, was equilibrated with at least 10 volumes of solution A (5 M GuHCl, 20 mM imidazole–HCl, 20 mM Hepes pH 8.0). Soluble lysate was then loaded at 1.0 ml/min flow rate into the column. This was extensively washed with solution A and then a linear 250 ml gradient was run from 0–100% of solution B (5 M GuHCl, 150 mM imidazole–HCl pH 8.0) at 1.0 ml/min. Fractions containing Li Pol&#946; were identified by sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)-PAGE and pooled. Then, 2-mercaptoethanol (ME) was added to 10 mM and the sample was stored in 1 ml aliquots at &#8722;80 °C up to several months. These fractions were diluted to approximately 0.1 mg/ml (final volume 20 ml) with 5 M GuHCl, 0.5 M (NH4)2SO4, 200 mM NH4-acetate pH 6.0, 1 mM ME, 1.2% CHAPS (Sigma).

The soluble fraction was used to purify the soluble DNase-I by IMAC on nickel-Sepharose. The column was equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 300 mM NaCl (buffer C). The filtered protein was applied and the column washed once with buffer (C), followed by a wash with the same buffer at pH 6.0 and a further wash with the same buffer containing 10 mM imidazole, pH 6.0. Elutions were performed with the above buffer at pH 6.0 containing increasing imidazole concentrations (50 mM to 1 M). Fractions were collected and analysed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Those containing the purest protein (100 mM imidazole elutions) were pooled and concentrated through 10 kDa m.w. cut-off membrane units and dialysed overnight at 4°C in PBS. Final purification was achieved by gel filtration (below).\nInsoluble material was treated and purified under denaturing IMAC conditions as described by Deonarain and Epenetos ([1998]): the column was equilibrated in 8 M urea, 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl (buffer D). Binding and washes were performed as described above, but the buffers used were buffer D (pH 8.0), buffer D (pH 6.0) and, for elutions, buffer D (pH 6.0) containing increasing concentrations of imidazole. Fractions were pooled as above and concentrated through a 10 kDa cut-off membrane unit to about 5 mg/ml.

During refolding, gentle dialysis was performed to minimize partial precipitation of the protein. From earlier studies (12, 19, 20), it is known that under these conditions the disulfide bonds of kringle domains and of the N-domain pair correctly due to the strong conformational determinants which seem to be present in both structures. The pH of the effluent was adjusted to 8, and 1,4 dithio-dl-threitol was added to a final concentration of 5 mM. After being stirred overnight at 4 C, the solution was slowly (6 h) added, with continuous stirring at 4 C, to 4 volumes of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8, containing 1.25 mM each of reduced and oxidized glutathione. The solution was dialyzed against 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8, and loaded onto a column of lysine-substituted Bio-Gel P-300 (lysine-Bio-Gel, 1.5 × 5 cm). After the column was washed with loading buffer, rNK1 was eluted with 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8, containing 200 mM 6-AHA (Figure 2B), dialyzed against water, acidified to pH 3-4 with formic acid, and lyophilized. Refolding was monitored by RP-HPLC on an Aquapore Butyl column. The totally reduced form of rNK1 eluted at 45% B as a sharp, single peak, and the completely refolded form eluted at about 40% B while the folding intermediates appeared between. This shift might be caused by the change of the hydrophobicity on the surface of the proteins. The finally purified rNK1 eluted as a sharp, symmetrical peak upon RP-HPLC on an Aquapore Butyl column (Figure 2C). The N-terminal sequence Met-Arg-Gly-Ser-His was checked by automated Edman degradation, and the amino acid composition yielded values compatible with the protein sequence and confirmed the absence of 6-AHA.	n/a		n/a	21	22	6 M guanidine hydrochloride in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 8; 5 mL/g of cell paste	19	n/a	Escherichia coli	BL21	PQE8	37	5.5 h	2 mM	no tag	0		1	n/a	1931	1037	1096	2008-03-28	2008-03-28	insoluble	1	694	1	2	n	n	0.7-0.9	600	Expression and Isolation of rNK1.

This extension was encoded partly by the sequence of the (6 × His) tag on the expression vector and partly by the sequence of the untranslated 5&#8242; end of the cDNA. The deduced amino acid sequence of the construct for the resulting recombinant protein was 298 amino acids in length and encoded a 32,422.86 Da product. The transformed E. coli clone carrying pProEx HTb with the construct encoding recombinant cTPI was grown in Luria-Bertani broth medium (1 L total volume) at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.5. Isopropyl ß-D-thiogalactoside was then added to the culture at a final concentration of 0.6 mM. Bacteria were grown as described above until the culture reached an A600 of 0.9–1. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (10 min, 5000 × g) and the pellets frozen at &#8722;80 °C until used.	Expression time is not stated	n/a	1e0l16

The Ni2+ elution was diluted 40-fold (vol/vol) rapidly in degassed buffer E (20 mM sodium phosphate, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM reduced glutathione [GSH], 0.25 mM oxidized glutathione [GSSG]; pH 8.0). The refolding buffer was prepared fresh, and refolding was carried out at room temperature (22°C) for a minimum of 15 h under nitrogen. The final protein product resulting from this refolding protocol was referred to as AMA1/E. Several other variations to the refolding protocol described above were also tested. One such variation included reduction of the Ni2+-eluted proteins with 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for 1 h at 37°C before refolding. The protein that was yielded after reduction and refolding followed by ion-exchange purification was referred to as RR-AMA1/E.\n\nIon-exchange purification. Ion-exchange column resins were sanitized with 0.2 N NaOH before use and then equilibrated to the initial binding conditions. After the refolding step, AMA1/E protein was concentrated on a DEAE Sepharose anion-exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (0.25 ml of packed resin per g of paste) and the column was pre-equilibrated with buffer E without the GSH or GSSG. After the protein was loaded, the column was washed with a minimum of 30 CV of the same equilibration buffer followed by 10 CV of buffer F (5 mM sodium phosphate, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA; pH 8.0). AMA1/E was eluted in buffer F containing a final concentration of 100 mM NaCl (pH 8.0). AMA1/E eluted from the DEAE column was pH adjusted to 5.7 by the addition of 1 M NaH2PO4 · H20 and loaded on an SP Sepharose cation-exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (0.15 ml of packed resin per g of paste) pre-equilibrated with buffer G (50 mM sodium phosphate, 0.1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl; pH 5.7). The column was washed with 20 CV of buffer G containing a final NaCl concentration of 275 mM (pH 5.7) followed by 10 CV of a pH exchange buffer (5 mM sodium phosphate, 0.1 mM EDTA; pH 7.1).

Medium consisting of Super Broth containing 0.8% glycerol and 12.5 µg of tetracycline ml-1 was inoculated with a 3-liter overnight culture started from production seed lot no. 0788. The bioreactor temperature was maintained at 27°C (pH 7.2), and agitation was maintained at 400 rpm. At a cell density for which the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) was 7.0, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mM. One hour later, cells were harvested by centrifugation and frozen at -80°C. Aliquots (10 to 150 g) from this production were used to develop a purification and refolding process of r-AMA1/E protein at the lab prior to scale-up (1,500 g) in a GMP environment.	n/a	n/a	1x0i18

This step was then repeated. The resultant pellet was then resuspended in 20  mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 containing 8  M urea, 2  mM EDTA and 50  mM DTT and incubated at 310  K for 30  min.\nA 40-fold rapid dilution with buffer A was then performed and (NH4)2SO4 added to a final concentration of 2.5  M.

The supernatant was then loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose column equilibrated in 50  mM phosphate buffer pH 6.6 containing 2.5  M (NH4)2SO4 and 1  mM EDTA. The GlcDH protein was eluted with 50  mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4 containing 2  M NaCl and 1  mM EDTA (Pire et al., 2001) and prior to crystallization, protein samples were concentrated to approximately 25  mg  ml-1 using a Vivaspin concentrator (30  000  Da MW cutoff; Viva Science). For crystallization of the binary complex of GlcDH with NADP+, the cofactor was added after protein concentration to a final concentration of 1  mM. Crystals were grown using the standard hanging-drop vapour-diffusion technique by mixing small volumes (5-10  µl) of both the free enzyme and its complex with NADP+ with an equal volume of a precipitant solution of sodium citrate over the concentration range 1.4-1.6  M in 100  mM HEPES buffer pH 7.0-8.0 and allowing the mixture to equilibrate by vapour diffusion with reservoirs of precipitant solution at 290  K. After approximately one week, crystals with a hexagonal bipyramid morphology (form I) with maximum dimensions of 0.25 × 0.40 × 0.25  mm were obtained for the free enzyme and crystals with a cubic morphology (form II) with maximum dimensions of 0.6 × 0.6 × 0.4  mm were obtained for the binary complex of the enzyme with NADP+.\nForm I and II crystals were mounted in X-ray-transparent capillaries. Preliminary data sets were collected by the rotation method with 1° rotations per frame using a MAR345 detector with double-mirror focused Cu  K X-rays produced by a Rigaku RU-200 rotating-anode generator. Data were processed and analysed using the HKL suite of programs (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997) and subsequently handled using CCP4 (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994).

Recombinant genes are transcribed in this vector by the T7 RNA polymerase (Studier et al. 1990; Pire et al. 2001). The gene encoding for T7 RNA polymerase is under the control of the lac promoter and may, therefore, be induced by IPTG. A high expression of recombinant GDH was obtained by addition of IPTG to a culture of E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed with the recombinant plasmid pET3a- HmGDH. The protein samples obtained from the induced cultures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gel, as shown in Fig. 2, displayed a very strong band in the insoluble fraction corresponding in size (subunit molecular mass) to the NAD-GDH from Hfx. mediterranei.

The vectors from positive clones were purified and transformed into BL21(DE3) pLysS E. coli strain for protein expression.\nTransfected cells were grown in 100 ml of LB-broth medium containing 20 &#956;g/ml ampicillin at 37 °C in a 250 ml-flask. When the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.4, isopropylthiol-&#946;-D-galactoside was added to the tube at a final concentration of 0.4 mM. Cells were grown for an additional 4 h, and then collected by centrifugation at 5000g for 15 min and frozen at &#8722;30 °C.

Inclusion bodies were sedimented at 50 000g for 20 min, 4 °C. The protein (Trx/L-HEP) was solubilized at room temperature in 10 mL of 0.1 M Tris–HCl (pH 8.6), 1 mM EDTA-Na, 20 mM dithiothreitol, and 6 M guanidine–HCl. L-HEP was refolded by a modification of a protocol for bovine enteropeptidase light chain [24]. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 80 000g for 20 min, 4 °C. The solubilized protein was dialyzed at room temperature against 3 M guanidine–HCl (pH 2.5), mixed with 10 mL of oxidation buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.3, 6 M guanidine–HCl, and 0.1 M oxidized glutathione), and dialyzed against 3 M guanidine–HCl (pH 8.0). To initiate disulfide exchange and refolding, the protein solution was dropwise diluted in 600 mL of 0.7 M arginine–HCl (pH 8.6), 2 mM reduced glutathione, and 1 mM EDTA, and incubated for 75 h at 4 °C. After dialyzing the reaction mixture for 2 h against 0.1 M Tris–HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 M CaCl2 at room temperature, complete autocatalytic cleavage of fusion protein took place. NaCl to final concentration of 500 mM was added to the dialyzed protein and active L-HEP was purified by affinity chromatography on STI-agarose. Two milliliters of STI agarose was equilibrated with buffer containing 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 500 M NaCl, and the protein solution was applied at 1 mL min&#8722;1 at room temperature. The column was washed with 10 mL of 10 mM Tris–HCl, 500 mM NaCl (pH 8.0). The active L-HEP was eluted with 75 mM glycine–HCl (pH 3.0), 500 mM NaCl; 1 mL fractions were collected and neutralized immediately with 50 &#956;L of 2 M Tris–HCl (pH 8.0).\n\nThe purified protein was stored in buffer containing 0.1 M Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 50% glycerol, and 500 mM NaCl at &#8722;20 °C. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of L-HEP was determined after SDS–PAGE and electroblotting into a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane [25]. The concentration of L-HEP was determined spectrophotometrically by absorbance at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 54,450 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 calculated from the known amino acid sequence [26].

The following set of oligonucleotide primers was used to amplify the agmatinase gene fragment by PCR: the first primer (5&#8242;-TGGTGGTCATATGCTACTTTACACGTATCGCTCATT-3&#8242;) introduced a unique NdeI restriction site overlapping the 5&#8242; initiation codon, and the other (5&#8242;-TCAGGATCCTCACCTAGCACTCATACCTA-3&#8242;) introduced a unique BamHI restriction site proximal to the 3&#8242; end of the termination codon. Plasmid pUAGM was used as a template. The amplified 0.9-kb fragment was digested with NdeI and BamHI and then ligated with the expression vector pET15b linearized with NdeI and BamHI to generate pEAGM. The E. coli strain BL21(DE3) codon plus RIL was transformed with pEAGM. The transformants were cultivated at 37 °C in 200 ml of a medium containing 2.4 g of trypton, 4.8 g of yeast extract, 1 ml of glycerol, 2.5 g of K2HPO4, 0.76 g of KH2PO4, and 10 mg of ampicillin, until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.6.

(22). Induced cultures were transferred to polypropylene bottles, chilled on ice, and harvested by centrifugation in a Sorvall GS3 rotor at 4 °C for 20 min at 4000 rpm (2700 × g). Cell pellets were thoroughly resuspended in 30 ml of ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, 40 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 (per liter of culture) followed by the addition of 7.5 g of sucrose, 6 mg of lysozyme, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 100 µg/ml. After incubation on ice for 30 min, the cells were lysed by osmotic shock by the addition of 30 ml of ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, 40 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, and 100 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and incubated another 30 min. The lysates were transferred to 250 ml of polypropylene centrifuge bottles and chromosomal DNA sheared by repeated rounds (3-5) of sonication with a Branson Sonifier 250 equipped with a 1-cm diameter tip. Lysates were maintained on ice during each round consisting of several minutes of sonication (50% duty cycle, output 60) followed by several minutes to cool down. Triton X-100 (0.1% final concentration) was added to the sonicate prior to centrifugation in a Sorvall GSA rotor at 4 °C for 30 min at 5500 rpm (4500 × g). The large, pinkish-brown pellets were resuspended in an equal volume (60 ml) of ice-cold 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT (TED) by sonication, recentrifuged, and washed again with TED buffer. The twice-washed inclusion body pellets were resuspended in 2.0 ml of TED (per liter of initial culture) and transferred to Eppendorf tubes for storage at 20 °C. Protein concentration (approximately 18 mg/ml) was estimated by the method of Bradford (23) by solubilizing microliter volumes of a 10-fold dilution of resuspended inclusion bodies directly in the phosphoric acid/methanol reagent which was then diluted with water. HPLC-purified DPPC protein and bovine serum albumin gave similar responses in the dye-binding assay, indicating that bovine serum albumin standard curves can be used to estimate DPPC protein concentration, as has been shown previously to be feasible for DPP dimer from S2 cells and for the BMP family of proteins in general (13). Insufficient sonication resulted in loose, jelly-like pellets of inclusion bodies due to contamination with high molecular weight DNA which could be eliminated by additional cycles. As an alternative to sonication, a French press could also be employed and may be more practical with larger preparations.\nIn Vitro Folding-- Inclusion bodies suspended in TED buffer were centrifuged briefly (~2 min) in a microcentrifuge and solubilized at an estimated concentration of 2.5 mg/ml in buffered chaotrope. The final molarity of chaotrope is not significantly lowered by addition of the inclusion bodies, which were diluted more than 70-fold from an estimated initial concentration of 180 mg of protein/ml pellet. 8 M urea or 6 M GdmCl, buffered with 50 mM Tris-HCl, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT, gave equivalent results. After incubation for 1-2 h at ambient temperature, insoluble debris was removed by a second brief centrifugation, and the solubilized protein was diluted 50-fold (final concentration 50 µg/ml), rapidly with stirring, into pre-chilled folding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 33 mM CHAPS detergent (1.8% w/v), 1.25 M NaCl, 2 mM reduced glutathione, and 1 mM oxidized glutathione) and incubated for at least 72 h at 4 or 15 °C.	n/a		n/a	31	19	 ice-cold 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT (TED)	5	n/a	Escherichia coli	BL21(DE3)	pJC10/DPPC	37	3 h	1 mM	no	0		1	n/a	1965	1037	1120	2008-04-09	2008-04-09	insoluble	1	652	2	2	n	n	0.6	600	Protein Expression-- For large scale production (approximately 160 mg) of DPPC inclusion bodies, four 3-liter flasks containing 1 liter each of medium (LB or NZY, pH 7.0; 200 µg/ml ampicillin) were inoculated with 10 ml (1:100 final dilution) of an overnight culture of the host expression strain BL21(DE3) transformed with the pJC10/DPPC construct. The cultures were grown at 37 °C to OD 0.6 at 600 nm (about 3 h), induced with 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-b-D-galactopyranoside, and harvested after 3 h. Overnight cultures were inoculated with a single colony from a recent (1-2-day) transformation of Ca2+-treated, frozen competent cells. Erlenmeyer flasks with baffles (Schikane-type) to promote aeration and media pre-equilibrated to 37 °C prior to inoculation appeared to improve yields of protein. Induction at OD 1.0-1.5 resulted in significantly lower levels of protein expression.	n/a	33 mM	1v0l47

The methionine residue introduced at the Cg-Def N terminus was subjected to CNBr cleavage by dissolving the lyophilized His6 fusion proteins in 50% formic acid, addition of solid CNBr to 10 mg/ml (final concentration), and incubation of the mixtures for 8 h in the darkness at 25 °C. The cleavage reaction was terminated by adding 10 volumes of water, followed by freezing and lyophilization. Then, the cleaved fusion peptide mixture was reduced in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8 in the presence of 100 mM dithiothreitol. The reaction mixture was purified to homogeneity using a C8 reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and the fractions of interest were lyophilized. The peptide was resolved with a 0–55% acetonitrile gradient developed over 30 min at a flow rate of 5 ml/min on a UP10C8 column (Interchrom modulocart uptisphere 10 C8, 250 x 10 mm). The refolding of the Cg-Def was performed at room temperature in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8 during 48 h. Then, the refolded Cg-Def was purified to homogeneity using an additional RP-HPLC step using the same column and eluting conditions as mentioned above. Alternatively, the cleaved fusion peptide mixture was directly folded at pH 8.1 in a buffer solution containing 0.1 M NaHCO3 and 3 mM reduced and 0.3 mM oxidized glutathione in the presence of 2 M urea and 25% N,N-dimethylformamide (15). Then, the folded Cg-Def was purified to homogeneity by RP-HPLC using a C8 column, as described above. Peptide purity was controlled by acid-urea PAGE, and the peptide concentration was estimated by amino acid analysis and UV absorption at 280 nm based on the extinction coefficients of the molecule. Molecular masses of the purified peptides were determined using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mode mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS).	n/a		n/a	4	2	n/a	1	n/a	Escherichia coli	DE3	pEt28a	37	3 h	0.5 mM	yes	0		2	n/a	1966	1037	1121	2008-04-09	2008-04-09	insoluble	1	136	1	2	n	n	0.9	600	Recombinant Cg-Def was expressed in E. coli Rosetta (DE3) pLysS cells (Novagen) transformed with the pET-28a/Cg-Def construct.

The solid denatured RNase A was dissolved into the reversed micellar solution under ultrasonic irradiation for approximately 1 h. The concentration of RNase A solubilized in the reversed micellar solution was determined by measuring its absorbance at 278 nm with a UV-vis spectrophotometer (U-best 570 JASCO). The average diameter of reversed micelles containing proteins was analyzed by a DLS-7000 system (75 mW Ar or He/Ne laser, Otsuka Electric Co. Ltd., Japan).

Various amount of reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) were dissolved in a 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.7, 1 mM EDTA). The aqueous solution (1 mL) was injected into 10 mL of 400 mM AOT-isooctane solution. Renaturation was initiated by adding 1 mL of reversed micellar solution containing glutathione into the 2 mL reversed micellar solution containing solubilized RNase A. The mixture was incubated at 20 C. The specific activity of RNase A in the reversed micelles was measured against time progress, considering the time when glutathione solution was added as the initial time. The renaturation yields of denatured RNase A was evaluated by comparing the enzymatic activity of denatured RNase A to that of native RNase A that was solubilized in the reversed micelles as a control experiment.	n/a		n/a	1	1	0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) containing denaturants 8 M urea and 0.3 M -mercaptoethanol	5	n/a	None	None		0	0	0	no tag	0		1	n/a	1967	1037	1122	2008-04-10	2008-04-10		1	746	1	1	y	n					n/a	1j0y49

One litre LB cell pellets were stored frozen and resuspended in 200 ml of 30 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8, 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM PMSF, and 0.1% Triton X-100, by pipetting, treatment with 0.1 mg lysozyme and sonication. Most protein impurities were solubilized by this wash buffer. AMA1 proteins remained insoluble and were repelleted by centrifugation at 8000g for 30 min. The AMA1 protein pellets were then washed a second time by sonination into 20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2 M urea and repelleted. The importance of this second wash step is uncertain. We included it because we were concerned about carry over of Triton X-100 into the refolding process. Examination of the AMA1 proteins by reduced SDS–PAGE indicated bands of approximately 80% purity (Fig. 3). However, if samples were not reduced the band was smeared and largely consisted of higher molecular weight disulphide-linked multimers of misfolded AMA1 (Fig. 4). The proteins were resolubilized in 200 ml of 20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8, 2 mM of 2-mercaptoethanol (2ME), and 6 M guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) by rotating the centrifugation bottles at room temperature overnight. In some preparations 2ME was not used at this stage. In the absence of 2ME approximately 50% of the AMA1 pellet was not solubilized in GdnHCl. The use of reduced or non-reduced protein dissolved in GdnHCl made no difference to subsequent refolding.\nProtein refolding\nAMA1 proteins were diluted into 20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8, 6 M GdnHCl such that the final protein concentration was 20 &#956;g/ml. Fifty millilitres of dilute protein was dialysed against 3.5 L of 20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 M urea, 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM 2ME, and 0.2 mM cystamine–HCl overnight at 4 °C. The dialysis bag was then transferred into 3.5 L of 20 mM acetic acid–NaOH, pH 5, 0.5 mM EDTA for a further overnight dialysis. At this stage a significant proportion of the AMA1 (approximately 20%) had precipitated out of solution, but this consisted of multimeric misfolded AMA1. Sodium azide (0.02%) was added to dialysed samples that were stored at 4 °C for up to 2 months.	n/a		n/a	31	2	Tris–HCl, pH 8, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2 M urea	1	n/a	Escherichia coli	BL21(DE3)	pBB117-pBB119	37	3 h	1 mM	no	0	n/a	2	n/a	1969	1037	1123	2008-04-10	2008-04-10	insoluble	1	800	2	2	n	n	n/a	n/a	Protein expression\n\nExpression plasmids pBB117 and pBB119 were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells containing the supplementary rare tRNA expression plasmid pRIL (Stratagene) and selected on Luria broth-agar plates containing 100 &#956;g/ml ampicillin (to select for pBB117 and pBB119) and 30 &#956;g/ml tetracycline to select for pRIL. Log phase cells were frozen in 10% glycerol to act as starter cultures. Ten millilitres of Luria broth (LB, 5 g yeast extract, 10 g tryptone, 10 g NaCl/L) supplemented with ampicillin and tetracycline was innoculated with 5 &#956;l of frozen stock culture and grown to confluence overnight. Ten millilitre overnight cultures were added to 1 L of LB containing ampicillin and tetracycline and incubated with shaking at 37 °C for 3 h. Cultures were then induced with 1 mM IPTG for a further 3 h. Some of the protein preparations were made utilizing richer media (35 g tryptone, 20 g yeast extract, 5 g NaCl/L) or media supplemented with 2% glucose. However, use of richer media made little difference to protein yields (Fig. 3). Moreover, the pRIL plasmid was not necessary for AMA1 expression but was used for most protein preparations because it improved protein yields by about 25% (data not shown).	n/a	n/a	1u0j50

The lysate was then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min. Because the fusion protein almost completely existed in the form of IBs by 10% SDS–PAGE analysis, the precipitate was washed with buffer A containing 4 M urea and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min. This step was repeated twice to remove the cell debris and other impurities. Then the IBs were dissolved in buffer B (10 mM Tris–HCl, 500 mM NaCl, pH 8.5) containing 8 M urea to reach a protein concentration of about 0.3 mg/mL. The dissolved precipitate was kept for 2–3 h at room temperature to completely solubilize the aggregate. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 30 min, about 10 mL supernatant was step-wisely dialyzed against 1 L buffer B containing 4, 2, and 1 M urea sequentially at 4 °C for about 17–18 h each. Finally, the protein solution was dialyzed against 500 mL buffer B containing 0.2 mM GSH, 0.02 mM GSSG, and 0.5 M L-Arg for in vitro refolding at 4 °C for 24 h. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 30 min, the supernatant was further purified in the next step. The in vitro refolding process was simultaneously monitored by size-exclusion HPLC equipped with a SW 300 gel column (7.8 × 300 mm) with 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.5, as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, and absorbance at 280 nm was monitored with a UV detector.	n/a		69%	31	2	10 mM Tris–HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, pH 8.5, and 0.1% Triton X-100,4 M urea	5	n/a	Escherichia coli	BL21(DE3)	pBSL-C	37	16 h	0.5 mM	no	0		79	n/a	1970	1037	1124	2008-04-10	2008-04-10	insoluble	1	676	3	2	n	n	0.5-0.6	600	o fuse the target gene to the C-terminus of CBD-intein reading frame, the Gel gene (753 bp) was amplified from plasmid pUC-Gel by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the following primers which, respectively, contained unique restriction sites for AgeI (forward) and PstI (reverse) to facilitate cloning: forward primer: 5&#8242;-GGT GGT ACC GGT GGC CTG GAT ACC GTG AGC-3&#8242;, reverse primer: 5&#8242;-GGT GGT CTG CAG TTA TTT CGG ATC TTT ATC G AC-3&#8242;.

After restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing verification, the pBSL-Gel was transformed into competent E. coli strain BL21(DE3) by calcium chloride method [13]. The resulting engineered strain E. coli BL21(DE3)/pBSL-Gel was grown in LB medium supplemented with 100 g/mL ampicillin at 37 °C until the optical density (OD) at 600 nm reached 0.5–0.6, and then induced by 0.5 mM IPTG at 12 °C for 16 h.

A recombinant polyhistidine (six-His)-tagged form of the mature M35 protein (rM35) was created by cloning the amplified gene into a pQE30 plasmid (clones developed previously by Sara Gomez Gallego), expressed in Escherichia coli M15 pREP4 cells (Stratagene), and purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid immobilized-metal affinity chromatography technique. The first 20 residues of the translated amino acid sequence are predicted to be a leader peptide that is cleaved during the assembly of the mature protein, which is typical of bacterial outer membrane proteins. The cleavage site was predicted to be after the sequence AQA, and N-terminal amino acid sequencing confirmed this. The rM35 protein was therefore designed to not contain this leader peptide.\nE. coli clones were grown overnight at 37°C on Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing 50 µg/ml of both ampicillin and kanamycin (Amresco). Single colonies were then grown in LB broth culture with the same concentration of antibiotics at 37°C in an orbital shaker to a relative optical density of approximately 0.7 at 600 nm. Expression of rM35 was then induced by the addition of isopropyl-ß-D-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mM. Expression of the protein was allowed to occur over the next 4 h (under the same culture conditions) before harvesting of the cells by centrifugation at 4,000 x g for 20 min at 4°C.

Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by resuspension in a hypotonic detergent solution (B-PER, Pierce). Recombinant protein was collected by differential centrifugation to separate inclusion bodies from soluble proteins, followed by subsequent washes in phosphate buffered saline at 4°C until purity of the recombinant protein approached 70% as assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Inclusion body proteins were solubilized in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and 150 mM NaCl, and clarified by centrifugation at 18,000g, 4°C for 30 min. Soluble protein was applied to a nickel-NTA affinity chromatography column at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Protein was refolded while on the column. Absorbance at 280 nm and conductivity were monitored continuously. Bound protein was eluted using an imidazole concentration gradient from 5 mM to 250 mM.

Two refolding protocols were attempted. \nThe redox method (De Bernardez-Clark & Georgiou, 1991;  Seeley & Young,  1991)  was performed as follows. To 2.5 mL of  solubilized  inclusion  body \nprotein was added 2.5  mL  of  10  mM DTT in  200  mM Tris-HC1 (pH 8.0). After reduction of the solubilized protein at room temperature  for 30-60 min, 1 mL of  100  mM  cystine  (dissolved in 0.5 N NaOH) was added to give ca. 14  mM cyst(e)ine. After incubation for 10  min to oxidize remaining DTT, this  mixture was added in portions to 10  volumes of 5 mM \ncysteine  in  100  mM Tris-HCI, pH 8.0. The final mixture, containing 0.5-2.0  mg/mL protein, and ca. 5-6 mM cyst(e)ine was shaken in  air on an  orbital shaker for 24 h at room temperature. The precipitated, aggregated protein was removed by centrifugation (6,000 X g, 30 rnin), and the supernatant was  dialyzed  overnight  against 200 mM Tris pH 8.5. The  sample was concentrated and further desalted by ultrafiltration (YM10). The final concentration for ca. 50 mL was 1.5 mg/mL.

Aliquots were analyzed for protein production and for the presence of the desired Apo-3 cassette insert.

This protocol was later repeated on  a 4-L scale fermentation by a  fourfold scaleup to obtain ca. 6 mL at 40 mg/mL. In the second method, DMSO  was  employed  as the stabilizer and oxidant during protein refolding (Tam  et al., 1991). Thus,  addition of 2.5 mL of solubilized inclusion body protein above was done in  100-pL aliquots to 30 mL of 25%  DMSO  in 75% 100  mM  MES (pH 5.6). Although a white precipitate was formed,  the mixture was shaken gently for 24 h at room  temperature, insoluble material was  removed by centrifugation, and  the  supernatant \nwas dialyzed against 50 mM Tris, pH 6.8, and then concentrated by ultrafiltration.  The  final concentration for ca. 10 mL solution was 0.7 mg/mL. Refolded protein was examined for the integrity of its pheromone-binding activity by photoaffinity labeling (see below) and for preservation of antigenic  regions by  Western blot immunodetection. In  addition, refolded protein was subjected to preparative IEF to monitor extent of correct refolding and to purify the correctly folded isoform. Gel filtration as a final step allowed  removal  of  oligomeric forms produced during reformation of disulfide bonds. 	n/a		n/a	31	3	0.2% Triton X-100 in 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 6.8)	31	n/a	Escherichia coli	XA-90	GDP-Apo3c	37	12 h	1 mM	no	0		1	n/a	1984	1037	1135	2008-04-14	2008-04-14	partial	1	658	1	2	n	n	0.4-0.6	600	Two ampicillin-resistant colonies were obtained.

Proteins were extracted from the washed-cell debris by homogenization with a Polytron (IKA T-50, Germany) in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7, containing 8 M urea and 5 mM EDTA. A separation step was carried out by centrifugation and the VP60 protein was renatured by slow addition of a buffer containing Na2HPO4/NaOH, pH 10. Most of the yeast contaminants were discarded by acid precipitation at pH 5.0. The supernatant with VP60 protein was concentrated and diafiltered against 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8, using a membrane of 30 kDa cut-off (AMICON, USA).

First four dialysis steps were done at room temperature, while the last three were done at 4 °C. After the last dialysis step, the dialyzed proteins were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C in an Eppendorf microfuge to remove insoluble aggregates. An aliquot (1 &#956;l) was analyzed by SDS–PAGE and Coomassie staining (Fig. 1B, lane 1) and bovine serum albumin (BSA, 500 ng/&#956;l final concentration) was added to the remaining Myc:Max preparation and stored in small aliquots at &#8722;80 °C. No noticeable decrease in DNA-binding activity was observed after up to 10 freeze–thaw cycles. Typically 100% of Max and about 50–60% of total Myc were recovered in the soluble fraction after dialysis. When Myc was dialyzed alone (in the absence of Max), only about 16% of total Myc was recovered as soluble protein. Thus, after dialysis we estimate that more than 50% of renatured Myc is in a soluble heteromeric complex with Max.

Different refolding conditions were tried as described in [21] and one condition was found for the renaturation of the L-protein. This was performed at room temperature by diluting slowly the protein solution (2.45 mL, around 200 mg of protein) with 400 mL of 100 mm Tris (pH 8.4), 5 mm EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol and 20 µm FAD. After 30 min, residual aggregates were removed by centrifugation (11 000 g, 15 min) and the supernatant containing the folded L-protein was concentrated to 10–15 mL by ultrafiltration using a 400-mL stirred cell (Amicon) equipped with an Omega disc membrane (30 K, Ø 76 mm, Pall Filtron). The protein solution was then diluted again to 50 mL with 20 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.2) and concentrated to a volume of 4–5 mL by ultrafiltration on a 30 K Omega membrane (Pall Filtron) using a 50-mL-stirred cell (Amicon). The protein solution was then incubated at 30 °C for 20 min in presence of RNase A (10 µg·mL&#8722;1), DNase I (10 µg·mL&#8722;1) and 1 mm MgCl2 and filtered through a 0.2-µm filter. The protein solution was then applied to a Mono Q HR 10/10 column previously equilibrated with a buffer A containing 20 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA and 0.5 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol.

The column was rinsed with 10–15 volumes of wash buffer (8 M urea, 100 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM Tris, 2 mM -mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5) containing 50 mM imidazole. Bound proteins were eluted with wash buffer containing 500 mM imidazole. The initial fractions contained TRIF and other low molecular mass contaminants, whereas the final fractions contained mostly TRIF (>90% purity). Fractions with impurities were subjected to size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200). TRIF was refolded by dialysis against 20 mM Tris, 2 mM DTT, pH 7.5, with the signature of the folded protein monitored by fluorescence and CD spectroscopy. From a 100-liter large scale purification, 50 mg was obtained with purity of >90%. The majority of the contaminants appeared to be TRIF fragments or degradation products. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UTMB Protein Facility) confirmed that the molecular mass was 77.2 kDa.	n/a		n/a	2	22	 M urea, 100 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM Tris, 2 mM -mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5) containing 50 mM imidazole	4	n/a	Escherichia coli	None	pET21d	37	4-5 h	1 mM	yes	0		2	>90%	2004	1037	1151	2008-04-16	2008-04-16	insoluble	1	284	1	2	n	n	0.6-0.8	600	Protein Overexpression and Purification—TRIF was cloned as a His tag fusion protein into pET21d vector (Novagen) and recovered from Escherichia coli grown in a 20-liter fermenter as follows.

After sample loading, the adsorbed protein was simultaneously refolded and eluted by introducing a gradient from buffer C to buffer E (buffer D + 0.5 M NaCl) in four column volumes. For comparison, the strong cation exchanger SP Sepharose Fast Flow (7 ml column) was used for IEC refolding at a lower pH. Here buffers C and D were replaced by buffers F and G containing 50 mM sodium acetate at pH 4 as the buffering salt.

The reductive denaturation and the oxidative refolding of lysozyme were carried out as described (Reddy K. et al. 2005). Briefly, the renaturation of the protein was initiated by rapid mixing of reduced denatured lysozyme with 60 volumes of degassed renaturation buffer (3 mM GSH, 0.3 mM GSSG, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 M Tris/HCl [pH 8.2]), containing organic salts as indicated. The final concentration of lysozyme was 280 &#956;g mL&#8722;1. For the screening experiments, the samples were incubated overnight at room temperature and analyzed for lysozyme activity after 18–24 h. Native lysozyme, incubated under the same conditions, without added organic salts, served as control.	n/a		n/a	31	1	n/a	5	n/a	None	None		0	0	0	no	0		1	n/a	2059	1037	1178	2008-04-29	2008-04-29		1	738	1	1	y	n					n/a	1e1z20

The LK68 refolded by two dilution steps was then acidified with hydrochloric acid to a pH of 4.0, and filtered through Sartopure PP2 (Sartorius, Goettingen, Gremany) filters, with 5 &#956;m pores, for clarification prior to column chromatography.	n/a		30%	31	8	distilled water	5	n/a	Escherichia coli	BL21(DE3)	pET11a	30	overnight	n/a	no tag	0		1	n/a	2080	1037	1185	2008-05-01	2008-05-01	insoluble	1	683	1	1	n	n	n/a	n/a	Expression and fermentation\n\nThe LK68 was cloned into the pET11a plasmid vector (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany), under the control of the T7 promoter, and then introduced to E. coli BL21 (DE3) [16]. The transformed E. coli was then cultured in a 500 ml flask containing 200 ml LB media (Bacto tryptone (Difco, USA), 10 g/L; yeast extract (Difco, USA), 20 g/L; and NaCl, 5 g/L) in an incubator with agitation at 30 °C overnight, and then transferred to a 5-L fermentor (BiofloIII, New Brunswick Sci. Co., USA) containing 2 L of starting media (glycerol 20 g/L; other media components), for the large-scale culture. In order to foster the growth and expression of LK68, lactose feed medium mixed with glycerol (glycerol, 500 g/L; lactose, 10 g/L; and other media components) was continuously supplied as a dual source of carbon and inducer in a dissolved oxygen (DO)-stat manner, which turns on the feed pump when the DO level increased above 50% of saturation and turns it off when the DO level decreased below 50% [18].\n\nThe quantity of LK68 in the fermentation broth was assessed by running the total fermentation broth (20 &#956;l) on Tris–glycine, 4–20%, SDS–PAGE, and comparing the LK68 band in the fermentation broth with the band formed by the standard LK68, which was finally purified and quantified via the Bradford method, using BSA as a standard, after the gel had been stained with Coomassie’s brilliant blue R250. In order to quantify the LK68 on the gel, we scanned the gel with ScanJet (Hewlett–Packard, USA) and the scanned images were analyzed with an analysis program (Biomed Instruments, Zeineh Programs, Universal Software, USA).	n/a	n/a	1x1h38

Screening for optimal refolding conditions was performed according to the instructions. Heme solution was prepared fresh by dissolving 10 mg hemin chloride (MP Biomedicals) in 1 ml dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), followed by rapid vortexing. The solution was centrifuged for 10 min (14,000g). The heme concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using the extinction coefficient &#949;385 = 56 cm&#8722;1 mM&#8722;1 [21]. All refolding studies were performed at 4 °C. The optimization of the refolding was based on turbidity measurement at 360 nm and by monitoring the GST activity (GST Gene Fusion System Handbook, Amersham Biosciences). The optimized refolding buffer (55 mM Tris, pH 8.2, 21 mM NaCl, 0.88 mM KCl, 0.44 M arginine, 1 mM EDTA, 10 &#956;M PEG, and 10 mM DTT), in the following referred to as buffer R2, was used at 4 °C. Urea-solubilized protein (0.5 ml and 5.4 mg/ml) was added dropwise (approximately 12 drops/min) to 10 ml buffer R2 under rapid vortexing. The diluted fusion protein was kept for 24 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 20,000g for 10 min. Buffer exchange from buffer R2 to phosphate-buffered saline (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2PO4, and 2 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4) was performed on a PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences) followed by centrifugation (10 min, 20,000g).

This solution was concentrated to a volume of 30 ml using a Filtron Ultrasette, 5 kDa cut-off tangential flow concentrator (Flowgen Instruments Ltd, Sittingboume, Kent, UK) and the concentrate was loaded onto DEAE-cellulose Productiv PSClO-DE column (BPS Separations Ltd., Spennymoor, Co. Durham, UK) equilibrated in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5. After extensive washing, the recombinant protein was eluted by a linear gradient (50 ml each) of O-0.8 M NaCl in the same buffer. \n	n/a		20 mg/l culture	1	6	relationships for both enzymes would facilitate the develop-	1	n/a	Escherichia coli	BL21(DE3)	pET3a	37	2 h	0.4 mM	no	0		53	n/a	2101	1037	1201	2008-05-08	2008-05-08	insoluble	1	658	2	2	n	n	0.4	600	E. coli BLZl(DE3)pLysS cells transformed with the recombinant plasmid were grown to an Am of 0.4 in LB medium supplemented with 150 &/ml ampicillin, and were induced by the addition of isopropyl-B-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.4 mM.Incubation was continued at 37“C for a further 2 h, at which time the cells were harvested by centrifugation (3,000 x g for 10 min) and resuspended in TN buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.15 M NaCl).

Approximately 5 mg of NTPDase6 inclusion body preparation was solubilized in 5 mL of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 2 mM EDTA, and 5 mM DTT in 100 mM Tris-HCl, denatured by heating for 10 min at 60 C, and then cooled to room temperature. Refolding was performed by dilution of the 5 mL sample into 250 mL of ice-cold buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM KCl, 250 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 500 mM (800 mM in some experiments) L-arginine hydrochloride, 2 mM reduced glutathione (GSH), and 0.4 mM oxidized glutathione (GSSG), pH 8.35, and proceeded for 2-3 days. Refolding experiments were performed at several different temperatures (ranging from 4 to 23 C) to determine the optimum temperature for refolding. After refolding, the 255 mL NTPDase6 sample was dialyzed against three 4 L changes of 50 mM Tris-HCl, 250 mM NaCl, and 2 mM CaCl2 (pH 8.0) for 2-3 days at 4 C to decrease the high arginine concentration that interferes with the hexahistidine tag binding to Ni-NTA beads.\nPurification of Refolded NTPDase6. The pET28a vector encodes a hexahistidine tag, N-terminal to the NTPDase6 insert, which allows purification of the protein on an immobilized metal affinity (Ni-NTA) column. Approximately 6 mL of Ni-NTA-agarose bead suspension (corresponding to a settled bead volume of approximately 3 mL) was washed three times with 10 mL of wash buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 250 mM NaCl, and 2 mM CaCl2, pH 8.0. Approximately 300 mL of refolded and dialyzed NTPDase6 was added to the Ni-NTA-agarose beads, and the slurry was incubated on ice for at least 1 h with gentle, occasional mixing. The NTPDase6/Ni-NTA-agarose slurry was poured into a column, and the unbound fraction was collected. The column was washed seven times with 4 mL of wash buffer. NTPDase6 was eluted from the Ni-NTA column in four 2.5 mL fractions of wash buffer containing 200 mM imidazole, pH 8.0. Eluted NTPDase6 was immediately diluted into 10 mL of ice-cold wash buffer (to a final sample volume of 20 mL) to decrease the imidazole concentration and promote protein solubility. All fractions, including the unbound material, were assayed for GDPase activity in the presence of Ca2+.	n/a		n/a	1	22	n/a	5	n/a	Escherichia coli	BL21(DE3)	pET28a	37	9 h	1 mM	no	0		2	n/a	2102	1037	1202	2008-05-09	2008-05-09	soluble	1	723	1	2	n	n	0.5	600	Expression of NTPDase6 in BL21(DE3) Cells.

Five milliliters of LB broth containing 1% glucose and 60 g/mL kanamycin was inoculated with 10 L of frozen bacterial stock derived from a single colony of transformed BL21(DE3) cells and allowed to grow at 37 C for 5 h. This 5 mL culture was added to 500 mL of LB broth (containing 1% glucose and 30 g/mL kanamycin) and grown to an OD600 of approximately 0.5 before induction with IPTG (1 mM final concentration). After induction, the culture was grown for an additional 4 h at 37 C, reaching an OD600 of approximately 1. Bacterial inclusion bodies were prepared using the Pierce B-PER reagent as previously described (27), typically yielding 40-50 mg of inclusion body proteins.	n/a	500 mM	1a1h56

The mixture was gently agitated at room temperature for 1.5 h. Then, DTT was added to a final concentration of 2 mM and the cells were disrupted five times for 30 s each by sonication in an ice-water bath. The insoluble parts of the mixture were precipitated by centrifugation at 20,000g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended in 40 ml B-PER reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA), that had been diluted tenfold using PBS. Again, the insoluble parts were collected by centrifugation under the same conditions. The pellet mainly contained inclusion bodies which were washed three more times as described above and were stored at &#8722;20 °C. Solubilization of inclusion bodies was achieved by incubation in 6 M GdnHCl, 20 mM Tris–HCl, 5 mM DTT, and 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, for 2 h at room temperature. The insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000g.\n\nThe denatured, solubilized fusion protein was purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a Sephacryl S-200 column (2.2 × 100 cm). The column was equilibrated with 5 M GdnHCl, 20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0 (column buffer). The denatured fusion protein (11 mg/ml) was loaded onto the column. The column was eluted with column buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions containing the fusion protein were pooled and sodium chloride and imidazole were added to a final concentration of 0.5 M and 20 mM, respectively. The fusion protein was loaded on a HiTrap Chelating HP affinity column, preloaded with nickel ions (1 M NiSO4) and equilibrated with binding buffer (5 M GdnHCl, 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, and 20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0). The pure fusion protein was eluted with 5 M GdnHCl, 0.5 M NaCl, 200 mM imidazole, and 20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0. Further washing steps were not required.\n\nBased on the methods reviewed by Rudolph and Lilie [25], a refolding protocol for the fusion protein was developed. The denatured fusion protein was diluted with refolding buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, 2 mM EDTA, 4 mM GSH, and 0.4 mM GSSG, pH 8.0) to a final concentration of 100 &#956;g/ml under rapid vortexing at room temperature. Refolding occurred within about 16 h under gentle stirring. Usually, about 250 &#956;g of refolded protein was obtained from 1 mg of denatured protein.

The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was loaded on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid His bind resin (0.5 mL of resin for every 100 mL starting culture). The resin was washed successively with washing buffer (20 mM PB containing 8 M urea) at pH 6.3, 5.9, and 4.5. The adsorbed protein was eluted with washing buffer at pH 5.9, increasing the molarity of imidazole (20, 50, 100, and 250 mM).\nEach of the denatured proteins was refolded following the procedure of Ewart et al. [29] with modifications. Briefly, the protein eluted with washing buffer containing 250 mM imidazole was diluted with a washing buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.2 mM 2-ME until the final protein concentration was about 100 &#956;g/mL. The solution was dialyzed against 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0) containing 100 mM NaCl and 1 mM CaCl2 for 48 h, and subsequently against 100 mM NH4HCO3 for 72 h at 4 °C.

The previously described SDF-1a purification (13) has been modified to the following two column procedure. All purification steps were performed at 22C. Cells from a 10-L fermentation (165 g wet cell wt) were resuspended in 1 L of lysis buffer: 50 mM Tris –HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl,  5 mM DTT, and 1 mM EDTA. The solution was mixed for 2 min with a polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann) and then disrupted with two passes through an APV Rannie mini-lab homogenizer at 10,000 psi. The disrupted cells were centrifuged for 25 min at 23,000g. The pellet was subjected to three wash steps (the first and third step with lysis buffer, the second step with lysis buffer 0.1% NP-40) followed by a final pellet  solubilization in freshly prepared 8 M urea. Each 1-L wash step included a gentle polytron disruption of the pellet followed by a centrifugation step for 25 min at 23,000g. The final pellet was dissolved in 200 ml of a buffer, 50 mM Tris –HCl (pH 8.0), 8 M urea, 100 mM DTT, and 1 mM EDTA, and stirred overnight. The 8 M  urea soluble fraction was complexed batchwise to 200 ml of SP Sepharose FF in 3.4 L of SP binding buffer: 25 mM Tris –HCl (pH 8.0), 8 M urea, and 20 mM 2- mercaptoethanol. The SP sepharose FF suspension was  mixed overnight. The resin was separated from the unbound fraction by using a Buchner funnel. The SP Sepharose was washed with 800 ml of SP binding buffer and then filtered to semidryness. The resin was transferred into 8 L of refolding buffer: 50 mM Tris –HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM reduced glutathione, and 0.1 mM oxidized glutathione. After 2 h, the resin was washed with 2 L of refolding buffer in the Buchner funnel. SDF-1a was eluted with 0.75 L of elution buffer: 25 mM Tris –HCl (pH 8.0) and 1.5 M NaCl. The SP Sepharose eluate was filtered through a 0.45-um cellulose acetate membrane and was adjusted to 0.1% TFA. Approximately 30 mg of the SP Sepharose eluate was loaded onto a reversed-phase Poros R2/H 16/100 column. The column was subjected to a 10 column vol linear gradient from 20 to 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA. The HPLC step was repeated 6 times to process the entire sample. The fractions containing SDF-1a(95% purity) were lyophilized, resuspended in PBS buffer, and stored at -80C.

1165	refolding attempt	8 M urea	13	redox-shuffling system in the presence of Zn2+ and Ca2+	0	0	n/a	Essential for the final yield of recombinant enzyme was the effective solubilization of the inclusion body fraction in 8 M urea. Contaminating E. coli proteins were eliminated by a combination of affinity chromatography and gel filtration. Purified short form 92-kDa gelatinase was obtained. Fig. 3B demonstrates the purification of the recombinant protein via two steps to apparent homogeneity. No impurity could be detected by silver staining.\nPreparation of eukaryotic proteins in E. coli often requires concomitant in vitro refolding. Renaturation of the denatured enzyme to active 92-kDa gelatinase was achieved after purification in a redox-shuffling system in the presence of Zn2+ and Ca2+. Under these conditions the recombinant protein remained soluble. Formation of insoluble aggregates during the renaturation process could be avoided by very low protein concentrations.	n/a		n/a	4	22	n/a	1	n/a	Escherichia coli	BL21(DE3)	pET12b	0	00	n/a	yes	0		83	n/a	2110	1037	1210	2008-05-13	2008-05-13	partial	1	644	1	2	n	n	n/a	n/a	The cDNA that encodes C-terminally truncated 92-kDa gelatinase (amino acid residues 113–450) was cloned downstream from the bacteriophage T7 gene 10 promoter in the expression vector pET-12b, as shown in Fig. 2.

A small amount of glass beads (0.3 mm diameter, <5% total sedimented bed height) were added to improve &#64258;ow distribution at the column inlet. The column was packed with 50 mL STREAMLINE SP for refolding experiments. The feedstock was conveyed by peristaltic pump (B. Brown, Germany). Three kinds of refolding buffers (see Table I) were used to perform the rhIFN-g refolding with a linear gradient of urea concentration. Prior to sample application, the EBA column was equilibrated with buffer A and the bed expansion was kept at the range of 2 – 3. UV Detector (K-2600, Knauer, Germany) was used to detect protein real-time. After the sample loading, the column was rinsed with buffer A until UV baseline was reached. The refolding of bound protein was performed in expanded bed mode by gradually increasing the ratio of buffer B1/ buffer A to form a linear gradient of urea concentration from 8 mol/L to a de&#64257;ned low concentration. After the refolding process was completed, the refolded protein was eluted with buffer B2 on packed bed mode.

The MT-d cDNAs were amplified by PCR, the amplified product purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and cloned into the pGEM™-T Easy Vector (Promega). To generate fusion protein specifying C-terminal His-tagged product, the insert from the pGEM™-T Easy Vector was isolated as a NdeI–HindIII fragment and cloned into pET22b (Novagen). An initiation codon was inserted at the N-terminus of the metalloprotease domain at an NdeI restriction site. A histidine hexamer was added to the C-terminus of the protein to facilitate purification of the recombinant protein using Ni–NTA resin (Quiogen). Each of the constructed plasmids was transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS, and grown in Luria–Bertani medium containing 200 mg·mL&#8722;1 ampicillin at 37 °C to a cell density of A600 = 0.8–1.0.

The solubilized mature ZmpA or preproZmpA was bound to Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) (QIAGEN), which had been preequilibrated in SB, containing 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, for at least 1 h at 4°C. The bound ZmpA was washed with 5 column volumes (CV) of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 6 M guanidine hydrochloride (buffer A), and 5 CV 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 500 mM sodium chloride, and 6 M urea (buffer B), followed by 50 CV buffer B to 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 500 mM sodium chloride, 1 M urea (buffer C) linear gradient. The bound ZmpA was washed with 5 CV buffer C, 5 CV 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 50 mM NaCl (buffer D), and 5 CV SB. The refolded ZmpA was eluted from the Ni-NTA with 100 mM imidazole. The eluted ZmpA was typically dialyzed against 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, prior to proteolytic analysis of the enzyme. Proteolytic activity was determined using 7.5 mg hide powder azure (Sigma-Aldrich) in 1.5 ml 10 mM Tris-HCl (43).

The cell culture was adapted to D2O by inoculating 4 mL of standard M9 minimal medium containing 33% v/v D2O with 40 µL of this LB culture and shaken at 37 °C overnight. 100 µL of the 33% D2O culture were then used to inoculate 10 mL of M9 minimal medium with 66% v/v D2O and similarly shaken overnight. A uniformly 2H,15N-labeled OmpX sample was prepared by inoculating 1 L of standard M9 minimal medium containing 99% D2O (Spectra Gases) and 1 g/L of [15N]-ammonium chloride (CIL) with the resulting 10 mL of D2O-adapted culture. This culture was shaken at 37 °C until the cell density reached an OD600 of approximately 1.0, and protein expression was then induced with 1 mM isopropyl-&#945;-D-thiogalactopyranoside. Upon reaching the stationary growth phase after approximately 4 h, the cells were harvested at 5000 g for 10 min. TE buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl at pH = 8.0, 5 mM EDTA) was used to resuspend the cell pellet in a volume corresponding to approximately 10 times the wet cell mass in grams and sonicated for 25 min using a Misonix 3000 sonicator.

The remaining insoluble pellet was resuspended in the same volume of TE buffer plus 2% (v/v) Triton X-100 at room temperature, pelleted at 4300 g for 30 min, and the supernatant was discarded. Triton was then removed by repeating the same procedure with TE buffer. OmpX was recovered from the inclusion bodies by resuspending the cell debris in TE buffer plus 6 M urea for 2 h at room temperature.

The cell culture was adapted to D2O by inoculating 4 mL of standard M9 minimal medium containing 33% v/v D2O with 40 µL of this LB culture and shaken at 37 °C overnight. 100 µL of the 33% D2O culture were then used to inoculate 10 mL of M9 minimal medium with 66% v/v D2O and similarly shaken overnight. A uniformly 2H,15N-labeled OmpX sample was prepared by inoculating 1 L of standard M9 minimal medium containing 99% D2O (Spectra Gases) and 1 g/L of [15N]-ammonium chloride (CIL) with the resulting 10 mL of D2O-adapted culture. This culture was shaken at 37 °C until the cell density reached an OD600 of approximately 1.0, and protein expression was then induced with 1 mM isopropyl-&#945;-D-thiogalactopyranoside. Upon reaching the stationary growth phase after approximately 4 h, the cells were harvested at 5000 g for 10 min. TE buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl at pH = 8.0, 5 mM EDTA) was used to resuspend the cell pellet in a volume corresponding to approximately 10 times the wet cell mass in grams and sonicated for 25 min using a Misonix 3000 sonicator. The solution was pelleted at 4300 g for 1 h, and the supernatant was discarded. The remaining insoluble pellet was resuspended in the same volume of TE buffer plus 2% (v/v) Triton X-100 at room temperature, pelleted at 4300 g for 30 min, and the supernatant was discarded. Triton was then removed by repeating the same procedure with TE buffer. OmpX was recovered from the inclusion bodies by resuspending the cell debris in TE buffer plus 6 M urea for 2 h at room temperature. Remaining cellular debris were then pelleted at 48 000 g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the unfolded OmpX in the supernatant was recovered for ion exchange purification.	n/a	2% v/W/ 600mM	1t2b17

After loading, non speci&#64257;c and unbound proteins were removed by washing the resin with buffer N3 until the OD280 \nreached a back ground level. During this wash step the protein denaturant, 6MGu-HCl, was exchanged for 8 M urea. There folding–renaturation of the PfCS protein was then performed while bound on the Ni–NTA column using two linear gradients. The &#64257;rst gradient reduced the ure a concentration from 8 to 4 Min 30 min. This was followed with the second gradient that further reduced the urea concentration from 4 to 0 Min 3 h. This was followed by elution ofa major protein peak with buffer N5. Collection of the protein started when the OD went above the initial base line of 0.01 and &#64257;nished when a new baseline was reached, higher than the starting base line due to the presence of the imidazolein the elution buffer.

The precipitate was dissolved in 20 mL of 20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.5, 6 M GuHCl, and mixed by inverting the solution for 4 h at room temperature. The solution was centrifuged at 27,000g for 30 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was diluted twofold with 20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.5. The same centrifugation conditions were used hereafter. The diluted supernatant was centrifuged after leaving it undisturbed for 4 h at room temperature. Supernatant was then dialyzed against 2 L of 20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.5, 1 M GuHCl for 16 h at 4 °C. For the Trx–(His)6 construct, dialysis tubing with a molecular weight cutoff of 14 kDa was used. For the (His)6 construct, dialysis tubing with a molecular weight cutoff of 3.5 kDa was used. The retentates for both fusion constructs were again centrifuged, but only the Trx–(His)6/OsNifU1A domain II fusion protein was purified further, because much of the (His)6 fusion protein had precipitated when GuHCl was removed. Purification involved Ni-chelation chromatography and gel filtration as described in the previous section. The purified Trx–(His)6 fusion protein was concentrated to 10 mL by centrifugation over a Centriplus YM-10 membrane (Millipore). To remove the region upstream of OsNifU1A domain II, 22 mg of the Trx–(His)6 fusion protein was digested with 125 U of Factor Xa (Novagene) for 16 h at 37 °C. The digestion mixture was eluted over Hi-Load 26/60 Superdex 75 pg. Pooled fractions, containing OsNifU1A domain II, were dialyzed against 2 L of 20 mM sodium phosphate (NaPi), pH 6.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 2.5 mM of 2-ME. After dialysis, all OsNifU1A domain II preparations were concentrated over a Centriplus YM-3 membrane.

Following centrifugation, the pellet was suspended in 50 mM Tris-HC1, pH 8.0, 1% SDS to a concentration of 1 mg/ml. The sample was boiled (10 min) and transferred to ice (15 min). Refolding was achieved by a three-step protocol that necessarily included Zwit-tergent Z-3,14, the same detergent in which Hib porin was originally isolated [20] and was found to be active in channel formation [21]: (1) SDS-denatured Bac porin was diluted 5-fold with a solution of 50 mM Tris-HC1, pH 8.0, 0.1% Zwittergent Z-3,14; (2) diluted Bac porin was lyophilized, resuspended in water to one-fifth its original volume and then dialysed for 12 h against 50 mM Tris-HC1, pH 8.0, 0.1% Zwittergent Z-3,14; (3) to ensure that the final Zwittergent concentration was 0.1%, Bac porin was bound to CM-Sepharose and eluted with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 M KC1, 0.1% Zwittergent \nZ-3,14. The salt concentration was lowered by dialysing (12 h) against \n50 mM Tris-HC1, pH 8.0, 0.1% Zwittergent Z-3,14. In attempting to refold Bac porin, several protocols were devised. Many protocols yielded \\'misfolded\\' Bac porin, a product which was included as a control for some experiments. Misfolded Bac porin was generated as follows: Bac porin, denatured in 50 mM Tris-HC1, pH 8.0, 2% SDS and at a concentration of 5 mg/ml, was diluted 5-fold with a solution of 50 mM Tris-HC1, pH 8.0, 0.1% Zwittergent Z-3,14. Dialysis (12 h) against 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% Zwittergent Z-3,14 served to reduce the amounts of SDS.

To sulfonate the peptide, the reagent 2-nitro-5-thiosulfobenzoate (NTSB) was synthesized from 5,5)-dithiobis-2- nitrobenzoic acid (Aldrich) [9]. One milligram PSTI-I was completely denatured by dissolving it in 1 ml 8 M urea, 0.3 M sodium sulfite pH 8.0, and stirred for 30 min at room temperature. NTSB (125 Ìl) was added and the solution was stirred for another 30 min. The reaction product was purified over a P-10 BioRad size exclusion column (1.6 ! 20 cm) equilibrated with 25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 5 M urea, 6 mM EDTA [10]. To identify the peptide, eluates were diluted 1:250 in carbonate buffer and a 96-well plate was coated overnight. The presence of the peptide was detected with the ELISA procedure described below. To the combined positive fractions, 2.5 vol of the oxidizing/ reducing solution (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 8 mM reduced glutathione, 4 mM oxidized glutathione, all Sigma) were added slowly over a period of 2 h [10, 11].

After inclusion bodies were solubilized in 0.1 M TRIS, 6 M guanidinium chloride, 100 mM DTT, and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8 (10 mg of inclusion body material/mL), at room temperature for 2 h, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (30 min; 30000g). To remove DTT, the solubilized protein was extensively dialyzed against 4 M guanidinium chloride and 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 6. To obtain binding of the His-tagged protein to an IMAC column (Qiagen), the pH of the solution was readjusted to pH 8 by adding 1 M NaOH. After washing the column with 0.1 M sodium phosphate and 4 M guanidinium chloride, pH 6.3, nPTHR was eluted by a pH shift to pH 4.5. Renaturation was achieved by dialysis against 15 vol of renaturation buffer (1 M L-arginine, 0.05 M sodium phosphate, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM GSH, and 1 mM GSSG, pH 8) at a protein concentration of 0.5-1 mg/mL for 4 days at 4 °C.	n/a		30-50%	4	33	 0.1 M TRIS, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7	5	n/a	Escherichia coli	BL21(DE3)	pET15b	37	3 h	1 mM	yes	0		2	n/a	2281	1037	1324	2008-06-30	2008-06-30	insoluble	1	625	1	2	n	n	0.8	546	For expression of nPTHR, the plasmid was transferred into the E. coli strain BL21(DE3). Since translation of eucaryotic transcription products in E. coli is often impaired by differences in codon usage, especially by the rare codons for L-arginine, AGA and AGG, we cotransfected the host cells with an additional plasmid, pUBS520, that enables constitutive expression of the corresponding tRNA (17, 18). For shake flask growth, 1 L LB-medium supplemented with kanamycin (25 µg/mL) and ampicillin (100 µg/mL) was inoculated with 10 mL overnight culture and cultivation was performed at 37 °C. At an optical density of OD546 nm ) 0.8, protein expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG. After an additional 3 h incubation, cells were harvested by centrifugation (15 min; 4000g).	n/a	1 M	1y2w95

The insoluble fraction containing more than 90% of the heterologously produced MSP-1 was seperated from the soluble material by centrifugation of the bacterial lysate at 40.000 g for 40 min and redissolved in 6 M GdmCl, 50 mM DTT, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0 (4 ml g&#8722;1 pellet) by using an Ultraturrax homogenizer. The suspension was further incubated under stirring at RT for at least 2 h before non-solubilized material was sedimented (40.000 g for 40 min) and the supernatant dialysed against at least 100 volumes of 6 M GdmCl, 50 mM Tris, 2 mM EDTA, pH 3.0 at 4 °C. The final protein concentration was typically in the range of 25–30 mg ml&#8722;1. Protein renaturation was performed at 4 °C according to a procedure described by Rudolph and Fischer [17] commonly referred to as “pulse renaturation”. In short, the solubilized protein at a concentration of 10 mg ml&#8722;1 was repeatedly diluted 1:100 in refolding buffer (1 M Arginin, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM oxidized glutathione (GSSG), 10 mM reduced glutathione (GSH)) in 1.5 h intervals until a final protein concentration of 1 mg ml&#8722;1 was reached. After the final “pulse” the mixture was kept at 4 °C for 12–16 h before it was dialysed twice against 50 volumes of 50 mM Tris, pH8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mM imidazole.	n/a		n/a	31	3	n/a	5	1 mg/ ml	Escherichia coli	W3110Z1	pZE13/f-HX42	37	3 h	1 mM	no	0		2	n/a	2283	1037	1325	2008-06-30	2008-06-30	insoluble	1	500	2	2	n	n	1	600	For expression of msp-1D42 and msp-1F42 E. coli strain W3110Z1 [16] was transformed with plasmids pZE13/d-HX42 and pZE13/f-HX42, respectively.

The homogenate was immediately centrifuged (10,000 x g, 10 min, 4 °C), and the pellet containing sCD59-Cys in inclusion bodies was washed three times by centrifugation in 50 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 2% sodium deoxycholate (w/v), pH 8.0, before being resuspended to 5 mg/ml in solubilization buffer (8 M urea, 20 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.5). Conditions for refolding of sCD59-Cys were chosen empirically by testing a large panel of solutions differing in their pH, presence of reducing and denaturing agents, presence of detergents, etc. as previously described (18, 24). Successful refolding was initially assessed by demonstrating the acquisition of epitopes recognized by the conformation-dependent mAb 6D1 in dot blots. In the chosen protocol, sCD59-Cys was refolded from solubilized inclusion bodies by rapid dilution (1:40) into 50 mM Tris, 1 M NaCl, 1 mM reduced glutathione, 3 mM oxidized glutathione, pH 8.0. The refold mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C and then buffer-exchanged into PBS and concentrated 10-fold by ultra-filtration (Amicon stirred cell; 5-kDa cut-off membrane; Amicon Inc., Beverley, MA). Aggregated and/or misfolded protein was removed by ammonium sulfate precipitation. Protein in PBS was diluted 1:2.5 into 3.8 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and centrifuged. The supernatant was retained and dialyzed into PBS prior to measurement of protein concentration.\nThe molecular mass of the final product was measured using matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF; Bruker, Coventry, UK).

Cells were then plated onto LB agar containing kanamycin (50 µg/ml) to select for clones containing the plasmid. Positive colonies were picked and expanded, and the presence of insert was confirmed by PCR screening. A single positive colony was picked into 25 ml of LB broth containing kanamycin (50 µg/ml) and grown overnight at 37 °C in a shaking incubator. A 20-ml aliquot of this starter culture was inoculated into 2 liters of NZCYM medium containing kanamycin (50 µg/ml) in a Bioflo 3000 Bioreactor (New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ) with a 2-liter bioreactor culture vessel. The fermenter was prepared and run as described previously (18). Cultures were grown for 4 h until the bacteria were in their log phase of growth (A600 = 5–8). Protein expression was then induced by adding sterile filtered isopropyl -D-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mM. The fermentation culture was harvested at 3 h post-induction and centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 min. Cell pellets were stored at –40 °C.	n/a	n/a	1r2l97

After washing with a bu&#64256;er containing 6 M GuHCl plus 20 mM imidazol–HCl (pH 7.0), the lectin was eluted with 0.5 M imidazol (pH 7.0) in 6 M GuHCl. For analysis of eluted fractions, small samples were precipitated with 4 volumes ethanol and the precipitates were dissolved in sample bu&#64256;er and analysed in SDS–PAGE. Lectin containing fractions were combined. The lectin was precipitated by dialysis against 0.02 M Tris–HCl bu&#64256;er (pH 7.7) and dissolved in 6 M urea and 0.02 M Tris–HCl bu&#64256;er (pH 7.7) containing 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). After dilution of 1:5 in PBS, this solution of recombinant lectin (rCHA-II) was directly used for haemagglutination.

The suspensions were centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 g and the pellet was discarded. Refolding was assayed with the AthenaESTM kit (Athena environmental Sciences, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Once the best condition was established, denatured proteins were immobilized on a HisTrap FF Ni-affinity column previously equilibrated with the same buffer, and connected to an FPLC Akta System. The proteins were refolded on the column by adding quickly the refolding buffer (50 mM Tris.HCl pH 8.5, 20 mM NaCl, 0.4 mM KCl, 0.5 % Triton-X-100 and 0.5 mM DTT).

Prior to sample application, the chromatographic apparatus was cooled to the chosen temperature. The Sephacryl S-100 column was first loaded with 0.75 column volumes of pH 7.4 buffer containing 0.2 M Gu-HCl followed by a gradient of 0.25 column volumes from 0.2 to 6 M Gu-HCl. When the sample was applied, the top of the column was in 6 M Gu-HCl, whereas from 0.25 column volumes downward, the Gu-HCl concentration was 0.2 M. After application of the sample and an additional small volume of high Gu-HCl buffer, the Y1-Sak was eluted with PB pH 7.4 containing 0.2 M Gu-HCl. As the proteins in the sample are excluded from the beads, they will flow through the column at a higher running speed than Gu-HCl, thus passing gradually from the denaturing to refolding buffer. The speed of this transition is governed by the flow rate. Thus, the effect of the flow rate on recovery of active Y1-Sak was investigated in the range of 0.5 to 2.5 ml/min. In addition, the effect of sample volume on the recovery of active fragment was studied in the range of 5.0 to 30.0 ml. In control experiments, the column was operated without the Gu-HCl gradient, and all other parameters were kept constant (sample volume 15 ml [10.0 mg/ml in 6 M Gu-HCl] and flow rate 1.5 ml/min).\nThe refolded protein was dialyzed against 0.02 M PB (pH 7.4) after size-exclusion chromatography. Then, the refolded protein was further purified by a Q Sepharose FF column (2.5 cm diameter&#8201;×&#8201;10 cm long) pre-equilibrated with 10 mM PB, pH 7.4. After loading, the column was prewashed with about 1 bed volume of buffer to elute a small amount of unbound impurities. Then Y1-Sak was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.3 M NaCl in 20 mM PB (pH 7.4). The elution flow rate was 40 cm/h. The elution peak was detected at 280 nm.

After incubation for 1 h at 25°C, the mixture was centrifuged [4,000g for 5 min] to facilitate separation of phases.  Three phases were \nformed: the upper organic phase, an interfacial precipitate and lower aqueous phase [see Figure 1].  The aqueous layer was subjected to a second round of TPP.  The aqueous phase was saturated with ammonium sulfate [35%, wv-1] followed by addition of t-butanol [in 1:1 (vv-1) ratio of aqueous phase to t-butanol].  Again three phases were formed and collected.

This simple purification step removes the urea and allows the exchange of the protein to the refolding buffer. Therefore, it allows the protein to refold into its native conformation. Processing of ppEhCP112 into an enzymatically active protein (EhCP112) was achieved by incubating 500 &#956;g of the ppEhCP112 in 1 ml refolding buffer supplemented with 10 mM DTT at 25 °C. This activation protocol is similar to protocols successfully employed with other recombinantly expressed CPs of E. histolytica, like EhCP1, EhCP2 and EhCP5 [15], [21] and [22].\nTo monitor the activation of ppEhCP112, 50 &#956;l samples were taken at 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 45 min, and analyzed by SDS–PAGE and gelatin–SDS–PAGE. In addition, a spectrophotometric enzymatic assay using azocasein as substrate was performed to corroborate proteolytic activity.\nTo determine whether the activation was an autocatalytic process, 20 &#956;g of refolded ppEhCP112 in 500 &#956;l of refolding buffer were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in the presence of 10 &#956;M E-64, 1 mM PMSF, or 1 &#956;M pepstatin A before the activation process with DTT. These samples were analyzed by SDS–PAGE after 20 and 35 min of activation.	n/a		50 mg per 500ml	4	2	20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, and 2 M urea.	1	n/a	E coli	M15	pQE80L	37	4 h	1 mM	yes	0		2	n/a	2316	1037	1349	2008-10-06	2008-10-06	insoluble	1	628	2	2	n	n	0.8	600	The precursor ppEhCP112 gene was amplified by PCR using the direct and reverse oligonucleotides: ppEhCP112-5&#8242; (5&#8242;-AGGTCGGATCCATGAC AGCGATTGTTGTCGCT), ppEhCP112-3&#8242; (5&#8242;-AGGCAAAGCTTTTAGATTGTATGATTGTAGAATTG), respectively, and using the plasmid pRSET A-ppEhCP112 as DNA template [2]. The primers contained BamHI and HindIII restriction sites (bold) to allow directional cloning of the amplified DNA into the prokaryotic expression vector pQE80L (Qiagen). Transformed Escherichia coli M15 cells with the pQE80L-ppEhcp112 construct were grown to inoculate 500 ml of terrific broth (TB) (100 &#956;g/ml ampicillin, 30 &#956;g/ml kanamycin) at 37 °C and 200 rpm; when cultures reached an OD600 = 0.8, the recombinant protein was induced by adding 1 mM of IPTG for 4 h. Bacteria were resuspended in 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0 (1 ml buffer per gram of cells), supplemented with lysozyme (1 mg/ml), incubated on ice for 30 min, and lysated by sonication.

When the OD600 reached ~1.5, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (15 min, 3,800g, 4°C) and the supernatant was discarded. The cell pellet (~0.8 g) was resuspended in 4 ml of the lysis buffer (NaH2PO4, 50 mM; NaCl, 300 mM; imidazole, 10 mM; pH 8.0 adjusted with NaOH) and then sonication (4 kHz, five times of 20 s pulse with 30 s interval) was applied. After centrifugation (10 min, 10,000g, 4°C), the cell debris and the supernatant was separated for further experiments.\nFor the expression of B. cepacia lipase, the cell debris was dissolved in 2 ml 8 M urea and the concentration (2.6 mg/ml) and purity of the resulting protein were assessed by the Bradford assay and SDS-PAGE, respectively.

Bacterial growth was initiated from a glycerol stock of the recombinant bacterial cells to 1 L of “enriched LB” which contained LB supplemented with 10 mL glycerol. The cell suspension was grown overnight to maximum cell density in a 2.8 L baffled Fernbach flask with a foam closure, shaking at 37 °C and 140 rpm. The cell suspension was then centrifuged at 10,000g for 10 min to produce a solid cell pellet. The pellet was resuspended into 1 L of minimal medium whose optimal composition included the commercial M9 minimal medium salts (6.8 g/L Na2HPO4, 3.0 g/L NaH2PO4, 0.50 g/L NaCl, 1.0 g/L NH4Cl), 2.5 g/L MgSO4, and 10 g/L glycerol at pH 8.0. Cell growth was continued by shaking at 37 °C at 140 rpm.\nMany of the experiments in this paper examine the effect of a parameter such as glucose concentration on cell growth. Each growth optimization experiment was done using a 100 mL culture volume in a 250 mL baffled Erlenmeyer flask and all of the growths as a function of a single parameter were performed at the same time in the same shaker. All of the comparative experiments presented in this paper were repeated and for each parameter, the trends in cell growth were reproducible. The value of the parameter which yielded highest growth was also reproducible. Examination of all of the A600 or &#916;A600 values between the different comparative growths showed that there was systematic variation by as much as 20%, e.g. for each parameter value, (A600)first growth/(A600)second growth would be 1.2. It was therefore difficult to estimate error bars which would reflect data uncertainties within a single comparative growth.Isotopically labeled FHA2 production. After 1 h of resuspended cell growth in optimized minimal medium, FHA2 expression was induced by addition of isopropyl thiogalactoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.2 mM. For production of FHA2 with 1-13C, 15N Leu isotopic labeling, 100 mg/L of labeled amino acid was added at the time of protein induction. FHA2 production was continued for 3 h at 37 °C. The cell pellet was harvested by centrifugation at 10,000g for 10 min, and the pellet was then stored at &#8722;80 °C until purification.	n/a	1 M	1x3e26

Four milliliter of this was transferred into 200 ml LB with carbenicillin (100 &#956;g/ml) and grown at 37 °C at 200 rpm in 1 l baffled glass flasks or at 300 rpm in 500 ml Ultra Yield™ flasks with AirOTop seals (Thomson Instrument Company, Oceanside, CA). The cultures were grown until OD600 reached 0.6–0.8 at which time isopropyl &#946;-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 1 mM. Prior to IPTG induction, one milliliter of culture was taken out and pelleted in a microcentrifuge and was referred to as the uninduced sample. The cultures were harvested after 3 h by centrifugation at 4500 rpm for 15 min. one milliliter samples for SDS–PAGE were pelleted separately in a microcentrifuge. Pellets were stored at &#8722;20 °C until analysis on SDS–PAGE or isolation of inclusion bodies.	n/a	0.5 M	1k3u32

The extraction buffer was 20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM &#946;-mercaptoethanol (&#946;-ME), and 1 mM EDTA. The homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm in a Beckman JA-20 rotor for 30 min. fortunately, the recombinant PDE8A1 fragments mainly existed in the pellet phase and therefore refolding was necessary to obtain soluble and active PDE8A1 protein. The pellet was dissolved in 10 ml buffer of 6 M guanidine, 0.1 M Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, under slow orbital shaking at room temperature for 3 h. The dissolved mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min to remove the insoluble debris.The supernatant was loaded into a Ni–NTA column ( = 2.5 cm, 25 ml QIAGEN agarose beads).

The fractions of the PDE8A1 catalytic domain from the elution were combined. The protein concentration was estimated by the absorption of A280 (1.097 U = 1 mg/ml), as calculated by program ProtParam [38]. Fifty milligrams of the PDE8A catalytic domain at 2 mg/ml (25 ml of protein solution) was added dropwise into 1.7 l of the refolding buffer under mild stir.

The supernatant containing refolded ATF5 was dialyzed using 1000 MWCO dialysis tubing with a cellulose membrane (Spectra) overnight at 4 °C into 2 L of phosphate buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT) to remove the guanidinium. The ratio of protein to dialysis solution was 0.04 L protein: 2 L dialysis buffer, which results in a 50-fold dilution of guanidinium to a final concentration of 12 mM. Any precipitation generated during dialysis was removed by centrifugation for 1 h at 21,000g and 4 °C. The supernatant containing soluble protein was collected and concentrated using a 15 mL 3500 MWCO Millipore ultrafilter with a Biomax membrane and exchanged into the same buffer solution (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 100 mM NaCl) without DTT. The solution was concentrated to approximately 1 mL and then exchanged into 20-fold excess buffer to further remove guanidinium, reducing the final concentration to less than 1 mM. Sample purity was assessed by SDS–PAGE analysis.	n/a		n/a	31	3	n/a	4	n/a	E coli	BL21 (DE3)	pET-42b-ATF5 bZIP	37	4 h	1 mM	no	0		11	n/a	2357	1037	1383	2008-12-08	2008-12-08	insoluble	1	1790	1	2	n	n	0.6-0.8	550	BL21 (DE3) E. coli (Novagen) were transformed with the pET-42b-ATF5 bZIP plasmid using the standard heat shock protocol.

All solutions contained .1 M NaCl, and 50 mM buffer. For the pH range of 5 to 6, Sodium Acetate served as the buffer. For the pH range of 6 to 6.8, Pipes served as the buffer. For the pH range 6.5 to 7.5, Hepes was the buffer. For the pH range 7.5 to 9, Tris was the buffer. The pH of the buffer was measured after dialysis. Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method (BioRad) before and after dialysis, following a 15-minute 13 K centrifugation step at 4°C. Additional purification steps: Following overnight dialysis into Buffer B (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 M NaCl, 2 mM EDTA), the sample was centrifuged and bound to a 1 ml monoQ column. The column was eluted with 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.6 M NaCl, 2 mM EDTA.
